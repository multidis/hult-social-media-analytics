2012-07-03 16:08:11,"HOW-TO TUESDAY: Model-worthy brows!

Embrace your inner model (like this gorgeous babe!) with super-bold feature brows! Groom them by brushing your brows upward, and use small scissors to trim the ends of any long, stray hairs. Next, stand in front of a mirror and find the highest point of your brow, then tweeze directly below this point that you have located. Less is more, so go easy! Try not to remove more than two rows of hair, as thickness is key. 

Next, draw short soft lines with our Eyebrow Pencil to fill in your brows. Smudge the colour with clean fingertips to make the look softer (but keep within the lines!). Finish off with a thin layer of our clear Extender lash & Brow Mascara to keep everything neat.",photo,,72,6,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Too many people get this horribly wrong... i think brows look stupid and hairy when brushed up like that!

2012-07-04 10:44:59,The big debate: Do you apply your concealer before or after your foundation? xx,photo,,103,130,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"after xo I always do it before. However it's good to use after for some touch ups
:) After :) AFTER! BEFORE!!!!!!!!!!!! Before foundation before for blemishes after for a mild highlight? for redness I apply concealer before foundation, but for blemishes I use a concealer brush afterwards. Before :D Before :) both before c; Before after After :)  I use to be old school and apply it first, but it makes sense to apply it after, only need to use where the foundation hasn't effectively covered and it doesn't rub off :) Before because concealers look pasty before and touch up after :D after :) Both After Before.  before or after sometimes i was told always after Before and after ;) Before :)  I just don't use it, why suffocate your face with excess when its not necessary. for extreme cases, where the use of a green or purple or even yellow concealer is needed you would apply first, but skin tone concealers you would apply after and blend with your foundation and finish with power to set Before When i did my ceitificate 3 in makeup i was told to put it on after :) after! xx After only if its a liquard foundation i do both or if my skins really bad ill mix my concealer with my foundation no After :) sometimes my foundation does job already but if I've got dark circles, I'll dab a highlighting concealer on the area and done! :) afteeeeeeeeer <3 after!! After, you pat it down, don't rub or slide it. And then set it with powder. Don't even need foundation if u just use your concealer to hide your blemishes  After BEFOREEEEEEE after after! before Both :) i dont wear it!!!! :P i use it without a foundation After foundation it is more clearer 2 see the definition of the eyes... before when I remember Before Before liquid foundation but after if using powder powder foundation. - Conceal before foundation for major flaws.
- Conceal after foundation (if still visible) for minor flaws like spots, small scars, etc. After to conceal whatever the foundation doesnt cover.. before After liquid foundation to touch up where it  wasn't enough, then I use a powdered foundation over the top with a finishing veil to set.  After foundation y use it u arent ugly u dont need it. wen u think ur ugly ur not every one else doesnt they all look at use and think wow i wish i looked like her or wow shes beautiful so dont use it ur just hidin ur true beauty :) Isn't it meant to be before.... So the patches are covered by foundation not on top of the foundation... I used to do it after, but then I got new foundation and it works better if I do it before before when under my eyes and after for blemishes Before and after depending on blemishes but depending on what type of foundation is used also.  always after so it doesnt slide around when you put foundation on top of it Liquid foundation - after
Powder foundation - before. before AFTER. After. Otherwise you just smudge it off with your foundation! AFTER! Unless its radiant touch, that can be but after to touch up if needed. Both both, depending on the type of foundation but i prefer to put it on after cause it looks much better I do it before and it works better  after biffless After. Always after! before! after liquid and before powder Always before :)  i dont need it :p after! i feel like i'm rubbing it off while applying foundation if i do it before... After so it doesn't shift. TAFE teaches you to do concealer before, but they touch it up after as well. before and touch up after Concealer but that woman looks like a god damn vampite Before After Moisturize, prime, foundation THEN concealer. Both Great Question i use to do it after primer & before anything else, but i once read in a magazine  to do it after foundation & set with powder,  so unless it's green concealer  i have done so ever since.  i double it as my highlighter by using a lighter shade, i use it under my eyes, down my nose & on my cupids bow. The only time I like doing concealer first is if the foundation is air brushed on after! Not where the foundation is put on after with a sponge or brush where it can take some of concealer away. after liquid, cream etc foundation but if im using powder foundation like the Australis (my fave) i'll apply it before so it doesn't run. but then i apply my setting powder aftwewards to keep everything in place. i think it blends better afterwards keeping a fresh bright face. otherwise the foundation would smudge the great blening and cover it up. i apply it on my dark circles and if i really feel like doing the whole routine i'll apply it on my cupids bw, on the sides of my nose and use it as a highlighter. unless it's coloured like green, then ill use it under or anyother colour or if is specifically says to. Both, it depends after, and then a setting powder, i never seem to be able to get complete coverage if i use it before! before so it sets and blends The concealer goes on after the foundation or else it may be removed when the foundation is applied. The concealer is then used on those areas that need to be covered up. concealer first, it makes for a much smoother finish after before before Before!!!! Always after... Foundation helps cover imperfections, concealer does dark circles. Repeat: always after After. After! Foundation base- conceal- translucent powder. After!!! depends on whether it's powdered or liquid foundation... I read to do it before then set it with powder, then put on your foundation then set with powder again, I do it on any marks I have on my face and on my top lip to cover the wrinkles. easyest, well  ireccon, before liquid foundation. if spots are still poking through then tiny smears over the top of your spots nd a finish witha loose powder. FLAWLESS! the trick of applying foundation after concelling is that you are not putting too much pressure on ur sponge (whatevs ur using) and just to dab and lightly blend. I use green concealer for my redness and acne so definitely before. Don't need it.?? Corrective concealing before, but other concealing (skin toned) afterwards as your foundation may cover it well enough :) before foundation Liquid foundation, concealer then powder After, otherwise i find my concealer comes off and i dont get as good coverage."

D: and when nailpolish goes shitty. and im like D: ""WHYY?! WHY ME?!"" people who wear chipped nail polish! ughhh take it OFF and have bare nails, or repaint! When the lighting in the bathroom is bad and ur makeup ends up just wrong Having makeup always looking slightly different and better on one eye. definitely dropping your compact! THE WORST!   Stabbing my eye with the mascara stick then having a full on black eye!:( When my sisters swap my makeup with either a lighter shade and I look like a ghost or a darker shade and I look orange :/ I hate it when they do that  Buying an expensive smudgeproof eyeliner only to find it spends more time smudging and flaking down my cheeks than a $2 shop one Dodgy nail polish job or getting watery eyes after applying eyeliner. Always happens. Also accidentally using the wrong shade of blush and u don't realize until you look in a proper mirror and notice you've been walking around looking like a clown wit bright pink cheeks ALL OF THE ABOVE! Not being able to find a decent foundations that's my colour Not being able to get the wings of my eyeliner even so I wipe it off and my shadow goes with it leaving a big mess   dropping loose mineral foundation on the carpet or getting some cream foundation on the clothes your about to go out in then havig to change again! other people using my makeup, ESPECIALLY mascara! Girls (or women) who don't take the time to find a foundation that matches their skin tone, and instead walk around looking 3 shades more orange/darker than the rest of their body. Chipping nail polish. When I'm doing my mascara and I sneeze = eye makeup ruined. :\ Opening your eye before your liquid eyeliner is dry and smudging it on your brow bone  Dropping and breaking a foundation. Also, not being able to find a foundation that matches my skin tone and having to compensate with a powder and having it fuller coverage than I need. :( when theres no makeup left :( Poking yourself in the eye with your mascara wand wrong colour foundation, screwed up manis, when my eyeliner turns out better on one eye than the other and harsh natural light, cause I can always see my blemishes ad try to cover them up more and end up lookin like a clown! I hate it when people dont clean their make up brushes inbetween eyeshadow  colours, they go in to a dark one 1st and then into a light 1 and leaves sum dark on top. Getting you mascara brush in your eye, blinking and getting your freshly applied mascara under your eyes and then having your eyes water on top of that. uneven makeup, or lipstick on teeth! Winged eyeliner when one goes up and the other goes down. Cloggy Mascara, just getting a manicure or pedicure and straight away chipping it!! Chipping manicure!! When your eyeshadow on one eye is uneven with the other! Pisses me off soo much! having to blow your nose just after finishing putting on your foundation and bronzer spending 1/2 hour trying to get my lip gloss exactly in line with my lip line >.< my lipstick coming off on any straw or cup or bottle just after i have put on my fave lipstick >.< having done foundation and then putting mascara on and ruining the foundation... found i should put mascara on first lol Smudged eyeliner! Forgetting that your eyes are done up then accidently itching them. As well as all of the above. Chipped Mani/ Pedi, definitely Dropping the bronzer powder on the carpet then.. accidentally STANDING on it!! going to get my makeup but theres nothing left because its all over my kids faces. hmmmmm lol That one eye looks great with the mascara you just applied but the other is just not quite right!! Getting mascara all over my face and when my nail chips :( Cand find the right foundation it always looks super fake and cakey also doing my eyes different :("
2012-07-05 15:59:10,Click like if you KNOW you shouldn't sleep with make-up on... But sometimes you're just way too tired to care!!!,photo,,1556,35,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"I never sleep with foundation on, but sometimes I'm CBF taking off my eye makeup. >.< yep! I always wash it off. Lol hasn't killed me, so it must be okay hahaha I have done this many times and NEVER looked like that ^^^ .. more like ... a hungover raccoon. i always forget to take it off lol Don't you people shower?! I wake up with panda eyes and dry flakey skin haha.  Even when I come home at 3 in the morning I wash it off lol I wish i were as graceful after a big night :( Noone is, Chantelle.
And agree with Erin.
We do, Kaitlin- in the morning  I hardly ever wear it, but when I do, I always wash it off! I almost always take it off before I go to bed. But sometimes I can be just too tired or drunk and I just fall asleep. Its not that big a deal as long as you just take it off in the morning and give your face a thorough cleaning. actually sometimes I'm too tired to wash my face when I'm not wearing make-up, so I wipe a make-up removing pad over my face.... haha i clean my face on my pillow.. so true Make-up remover wipes are really handy buy them for $2. use 3 of them at a time =) Biore and Olay even Priceline has their own brand. Easy peasy xo Coles and Kmart have the $2. ones i ALWAYS sleeep with make up ALWAYSSS Whats so bad about it? I always sleep with it on? whenever ive had makeup on and have to go to bed ive been to tired to even care and anyway what is the worst that can happen Get a pack of johnsons baby wipes..... They are the best at removing all types of make up and way cheaper than expensive make up removal wipes. So easy to pull one out  the pack and wipe it over your face.  Its my night routine, i always wash off my makeup and cleanse my face & moisturise. I feel uncomfortable sleeping with it on. if u have  have enough effort for a shower. ur not drunk enough haha ;-) Very sexy and seductive. Love it <3 Would take at least 24hrs to get all that shit off her eyes what is wrong with what she did? really bad 4 u"

2012-07-10 15:51:10,"HOW TO TUESDAY: Two-tone lips!

This look is ALL about vibrant, bold lip colours so make sure your lips are smooth and flake-free first! Apply your fave Australis liquid foundation to clean dry lips with your fingers, creating a flat canvas for the colour. Allow to dry for a few minutes, then blot with a clean tissue to remove excess oil. 

Pick two contrasting shades of our Colour Inject Mineral Lipstick, and apply them carefully to either your top or bottom lip. Use a lip brush to get your edges SUPER neat, blot and reapply! Lightly dust your lips with our Ready Set Finishing Powder to make this look last for HOURS!

Kyralee Teale hehehe yes,  if i didnt, m friend would probably kill me Hell yes! why would you not, thats what friends do yes Only if it was fixable at the time, it's awful to be self conscious all day. Yes I would. I'm sure she'd feel much better knowing she doesn't look like a clown lol yes Yes!! Otherwise what kind of friend would I be? yes i walk up and rub it in for her lol Absolutely! yes cos I remember several times when MY makeup has gone all gross and she hasn't said anything. YES DEFS!!! yes i would tell her I always do, but try to do it discretely otherwise they might get a lil mad. :) x Yes yes totally Yes! I know I would want to be told if I had blotchy makeup :) Yes cas I'd want the same done for me yes i dont want them to embarass themselves and everyone looking at her would make me feel bad that i noticed it but never told her It depends wether we are somewhere she can change it or fix it but if we aren't its no use worrying her for nothing. Of course you tell her! Even if she can't fix it up with more makeup, she can probably get it off. No makeup is better than really shitty makeup. yes because your not a REAL friend if you don't I would definitely tell her because I'd want her to do the same with me if I've made a mistake. Defs. My mum still lets me know if i've done crappy job of my make up......especially when i'm in a hurry to leave the house yess i would totally tell her yes!!!. Yes! What kind of friends would let the other look like she has war paint on her. Yes i would probably be the one to fix it to Duh yes honesty is the best policy Yeah! Yeah i would but none of my friends wear makeup :P i will toatlly let my friend know :) Yea Yes  Hell no! 
I'd just take her to the bathroom and touch up my own make-up and hope she notices hers, I'd hate it if someone told me I had blotchy make-up, so why tell my friend when it would probably have the same affect on her? yep i would if shes my friend yes Yeah, I'd be like, ""Sweetheart, go fix yourself up, you look like a freaking clown D:"" yup depends who it was yes Yeah. It'd be awkward, but meh. I wouldn't want her walking around with a blotchy face all day. i sure would, if i had a problem with mine id want to be told so i could fix it. so long as you dont say it in a harsh way. yep just as long as it was said nicely yup"

Which would you rather wear on a hot date: glossy lips or bold, red lipstick?",photo,,287,70,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"bold, red lipstick gloss bold red, if it suits you otherwise a bit of lip gloss. Red always :) gloss red,guys hate sticky gloss,but dont mind red smeared everywhere,my trials prove this haha Glossy lips. Normally I would say bold, red lipstick but that's more for second date. :) Bold red lipstick glossy green bold red!! Glossy guys find it more appealing, Gloss RED !  Red! Gloss! A lot of men are put off kissing red lipstick lips so go the gloss. Red lipstick  Gloss! BOTHXXXXX Bold red lipstick  , yeah gloss Gloss is sticky and thus bad for dates! It really depends on my outfit and the rest of my makeup... Personally, I'd go for a nice light red lip stain. Bold red Cant pull off red lippy to save my life.. So i'd go a pretty pink or nude instead :) bold n red, or plum red <3 Bold red lippy! red, less of a mess than glossy Hmm red if you can pull it off
But not for a first date Glossy  Gloss gloss for sure I would go for a lipbalm, it's less messy for the good night kiss ;-) red doesnt suit me so gloss or pink Lippy but not as bold as red Red bold Red or a lippy that matches my outfit, gloss is ultra sticky and no one wants jizz lips one a date :z Neither... It's all about the eyes for me. 
In saying that, I have been with my fiance 6 years so I don't wear much makeup at all on our dates. So it hard to say Really glossy lips are gross.... Bold red lips for sure! Always a winner :) Bight your lips to get red-glow au-naturale and then lick, cos u just know that what you have on when you left home aint gonna last never mind what BS they tell ya....   and its now midnight and the coach is leaving right?  Get your Goddess on and never mind the war paint! Bold Red Lipstick. My friends and boyfriend said ""Red Lipstick suits me"" Bold red red lipstick totally stunning! red :) BOLD RED <3 the bold red depends what kinda date ur going on romantic date DEFINITELY RED fun date GLOSS but would def perferr red <3 Glossy lips Bold lipstick GLOSSY LIPS OF COURSE! RED LIPS MAKE U LOOK OLDER... WELL IT MAKES ME LOOK OLD glossy but gutys prefer lipsticks red lipsrick beautiful this lipstick! lip glosss Red lipstick with a coat of gloss. would depend on the person and the outfit i was planning to wear :O but probably red ^^ Gloss all da way red."

Tinted moisturiser! I use a BB for everyday !!! Tinted moisturiser foundation! I used the Papazzi Foundation mostly (and was commented how glowing it was), I use tinted moisturiser when it is just a casual day. i tend to use tinted moisturiser or a bb cream under my foundation these days,it reduces the amount of foundation i need and leaves me looking like my skin is just flawless Foundation! I use that foundation aswell :) Tinted moisturiser never matches my skin tone Does the tinted moisturiser have spf in it? Oops- just saw that it is an spf 15. Was hoping it was a 30+.... Tinted Moisturiser. For sure. Foundation Before baby, when I had me time, foundation - mineral, though. After baby, TM has been a savior. I can look half decent in no time Neither - everday essentials don't extend to makeup lols! I don't wear tinted moisturiser though, cause its always ridiculously dark, and I think its more attractive to keep your skin looking pale and natural lol. But if I do wear makeup, its always foundation :)
 Neither. I don't have problem skin and I don't see why I should wear it. I may wear foundation when going out though Ive never really used tinted moisturiser since I need more coverage I always go for foundation moisturiser foundation make my face have a pimples. thats why i dont use anything on my face.. tiinted moisturiser with concealer for every day it has to be tinted moisturiser foundation ...or bust!

Haha I have totally done this before when my fringe gets a bit greasy! Works a treat :D How the hell does that clean your hair ? It carnt ?  It's the same with baby powder  it dose even baby powder works its not to clean it just too freshen up stop it looking greasy Doesn't clean ur hair, just makes it less oily :) i think thats christina from the e factor the powder works by soaking up any excess moisture in your hair, that's why it's a nice tip to know if your hair gets oily Omg thx you just saved my relationship with my hair of cause lol Where can we buy this lil gem of a product Hi Caryn!

Please send us a pic! xx yeah that appears to be a british mani considering how complex the Oz flag is, the easiest way to go would be to just paint your nails green and gold (which usually winds up being more of a green and yellow) it would be more inpressive if she did it alone on real nails with the real brush... then we will see how many likes she gets and hows many '?? what is it' comments shell get! :P thats cool! impressive* That's a British flag.

How do u apply primer? dont use paint bad for your health What primer used for  It's my MUST HAVE!!!!! eye, face and lip primers, for me it's just as important as a moisturiser! Those waiting a flawless full coverage do the following:

* in the morning remove excess sweat and oil with a makeup wipe (i cleanse tone and exfoliate the night before when i remove my makeup) 
* apply a day cream with sunscreen all over the face and neck
*let it dry for a minute and then apply australis primer with fingers all over face and neck
* apply australis mineral liquid foundation first with a brush then apply extra on parts that need a bit more coverage with fingers. blend edges with fingers 
*apply australis fresh and flawless with a hard sponge or flat kubuki and make sure you actually press it firm into skin
* apply a gentle sweep of australis ready set go finishing powder with a large kubuki all over.

rough prices:
makeup wipes: $4
moisturiser with sunscreen: $10
australis primer: $12
australis liquid foundation: $20
australis fresh and flawless pressed power: $12
ready set go finishing powder $15

TOTAL:$73 
bare in mind those products will last on average 3 months. so only $24 a month.....less than a dollar a day for beautiful makeup. 
you could easily add a shadow pallet and mascara and keep it under $100.

honestly I've spent $70 on a single makeup product before and unless you are trying to impress someone with a brand name then go for Australis. its cheap but the products are so good and easy to use.

i will admit im a trained beauty therapist so know how to apply makeup but i get so many compliments on my face makeup and people are amazed its all australis.

I love australis!!! @debz - to make lipsticks last longer take a teaspoon of brown sugar and a tiny bit of honey and make a small paste.  using fingers rub all over lips much like an exfoliant. your face needs exfoliating to remove all dead skin so your makeup can 'stick' better, your lips are the same. lots of dead dry skin sells. so use the sugar honey paste once a week at night time. Dont go too rough just gentle. Thanks for all your great tips Melissa no, but I always use photoshop so is primer really that essential?? i have no idea what you guys are talking about haha Thanks melissa :) Kandii, we love Primer because it helps foundation go on smoother and last longer :) Photoshop much."

If you're planning on glamming it up and applying eyeshadow to your lower lash line, dab a little Primer there too!

2012-08-21 15:48:47,"HOW TO TUESDAY: Keep your brushes beautiful!

We <3 make-up brushes because they give you flawless and gorgeous look... But only if you keep them in prime condition! 

Moisten your brush with warm water first, then lather up gentle face wash or baby shampoo on the back of your hand and swirl the bristles through it. Rinse well until the water runs clear. Blot off excess water with a clean tissue and gently reshape the bristles with your fingers.

Hot tip: never handle the bristles too roughly or try to pull them apart!",photo,,135,7,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"At the college (makeup artistry) we learnt to use a mild antibacterial wash (I use lavender dettol as it smells great even after brushes have dried) to clean the brushes daily..same technique as above, just with the added benefit of an antibacterial agent to thoroughly cleanse between clients. Also a good brush cleaner or alcohol spray is great for when you don't have time to wash and dry brushes during the day. Good tip, Zoe! Thanks xx You can also use isopropyl alcohol in a spray bottle... spray the brush and dry with a paper towel. If you like to shampoo your brushes don't use really hot water because you might melt the glue and cause the brush to fall apart. Omg thank you Great advice, Gemma! Thanks for sharing <3 <3 Just tried this and oh my God  they look bran new yay"

We will be running a Twitter competition later this week that you can access from phones xx I've entered 4 comp thru Facebook they worked eventually especially those companies provided not only myself but others several links thru my android phone so Facebook does use it so I don't know where or who told you that and i wouldn't tell you if it weren't true and does work. Hi Jo-Anne! Thanks for your feedback :) Our competition has been built as a Facebook tab and not as a mobile website, which may have been the case with these other competitions. Our super awesome web developer has said that it is possible sometimes to enter these Facebook competitions on mobiles if you use your internet browser on your phone (and not the Facebook app) if that helps. Otherwise, the giveaways close at the end of the month so hopefully that's enough time for you to find a friend's computer? Thanks so much! xx Taylah Plunkett :)"

No. No cause I will be to hunger game-yish *it no Possibly I'd wear it at a photoshoot or something - but never in public! if I could get the line straight enough Take risks that's what fashion is all about That's a really nice shade of photoshop she's wearing This sort of thing is very easy to do with a good felt-tipped eyeliner. I wear liner looks like this out all the time. Dare to be bold, ladies :) I would if my aspirations of a musician work out Nope too much Uhh yeah if it wasn't so photoshopped. Could b achieved with a bit of tape and a good brush, though. yep!!!! yes Yes, already do Thats cool  Hell yes! Love it <3 I would, but I don't because people would be like ""what is wrong with you"" o.O hell no airbrushed, much? the photo shopping doesn't even make her look good. its actually creepy No way Yap Yes if I am 22 years olds. God, you photoshopped the hell outta this, huh? I would if I could flipping do it! How photoshopped could this girl get? I would love to wear it now,but I am afraid of the consequences.... :) Anyone know what lipstick this is? ^ it's a crease in her neck, but yeah it still kinda fails.

Natural beauty is the best<3 you can't find your beauty by putting on makeup :| if used correctly, make up is used to enhance your natural features, not to cover them up. makeup makes people feel beter about themselves and it doesn't cover natural beauty it enhances it. Saying that you should show your natural beauty by not wearing makeup is incredibly insulting to those of us who don't have perfect skin. Apparently you believe that those of us with rosacea, enlarged pores, acne scarring, etc don't deserve to feel beautiful. There's nothing wrong with wearing make up :) It can make everyone look beautiful and feel good and in my book that's not something to criticise :) RIP Kevyn Aucoin. A beautiful and compassionate person both inside  and out. We all have parts we don't like about ourselves, but when we wear the right clothes, a great pair of shoes or do our make-up, we look beautiful to ourselves and that's what makes us look beautiful to everyone else"

This is one for girls who LOVE winged eyeliner but can't get their lines straight ;) On clean eyes, use two pieces of magic tape to create a triangle in the outer corner of your eyes. Using our Liquid Liner, fill in shape created by the tape, wait 30 seconds for it to dry, then remove the tape slowly.

Fill in any gaps and fix up any wonky edges if needed, then line your upper lash line. Follow up with lashing of our Killer Curves Mascara. Practice this at home a few times to get each eye super-even!

This season's hottest smokey eye look sees gorgeous brown hues taking centre stage! Prep eyes with our Eyeshadow Primer, then apply the medium brown shade of our Paparazzi Perfect HD Eye Shadow in 'Snap Attack' all over your lids with clean fingers. Use a sponge applicator and apply a light wash of the same eyeshadow under your lower lashes. Use clean fingers and apply the darkest brown from the same palette lightly over your mobile lids, then 'pat' on the eyeshadow to add to the intensity and build up the colour. Use a smaller eyeshadow brush or a clean cotton bud to add the darker shade to your lower lash line.

Line your upper and lower lash line with our 'Midnight' Stayput Liner, and don't forget to give your waterline some lovin' too. Follow up with lashings of mascara and use a fan brush to flick away any eyeshadow fallout under your eyes.

From top to bottom, Jitterbug is our red with blue undertones. Make A Wish is our orange red (and it's Limited Edition!) and Cha Cha is a burgundy shade. xx Australis do you have lip liners to go with the lippys ? Make a wish I'm a makeup artist and love allll of your products, jitterbug is def the one for me. :-P xx cha cha!! :D"

*also men, and anyone who identifies outside of these. Ahahahaha Love this Maybe girls should stop dating cockheads n date nice guys instead, coz all girls have a guy friend they turn to after the cockhead breakes there heart, n I was one of those ppl n I loved that girl but it breaks your heart to see em not wake up to what's infront of them the whole time. But because u love this girl it hurts even more to think of them crying alone. If only they knew. Thats why you shouldn't like this post, coz girls who relate to this post are just going to do the same thing over n over again That's so cute Or the fact you cant go tell a random girl she is beautiful (not in a sleazey way) unless your a cockhead douchebag(who means it in a sleazy way) with muscles, because its creepy.

Apply our Paparazzi Perfect Tinted Moisturiser over fresh, clean skin. Use your fingers to blend to give you a smooth base. Pump out your chosen High Lights Mineral High Lighter (Gold for darker or warmer skin tones, Pearl for cooler or lighter skin) on the back of your hand, and use your fingertips to lightly dot them along your cheekbones and the bridge of your nose. Blend the dots into your skin in circular motions so there are no harsh lines.

Don't like it at all.....Looks like it's been thrown together from the OP shop....

Who the hell picks these garments?! take away the gold trimmings and make the neck low cut i would wear this for sure! I love it and i want the shoes!!! where are these designers from? uranus? I have totally run out of words...omg! What part of Australia is it suppose to represent? They should really consider the end product before they start sewing. What part of Australia is white and gold with a feather? I saw it on sunrise when they had the designers in...the model could hardly walk in those shoes! It's supposed to look like a cockatoo? Looks more like a galah... Nothing Australian about it, lol Noooooo It's not great It's awful! Unflattering and UnAustralian Very cheap and tacky. : / It's made incredibly bad no way ,this not represent australia. NIce shoes. no. Since when did australiana become greek goodesses?? how about colours inspired by the land... reds.. browns.. yellows.. skye blue etc.. like ayers rock..??? This looks like something you'd wear to a toga party at uni. I just don't get the outfit. It looks incredibly tacky, poor quality, and nothing about it reflects Australia. Granted, it's a hard task as we don't have a national dress as such, but even so...this is the best they could do?

The foundations should all be priced under $20 :) Let us know which retailer and we'll look into it for you! xx hy where i shop, the foundaion i used to use is chaper instore than on your sit Would love if you brought out a couple lighter shades, or foundations with different undertones! Huge fan of the paparazzi line! Comes out amazingly in photoshoots with the teeniest amount! x Fresh & Flawless is a primer, not a foundation. But I do agree that Australis (much as I love it) could use some more ivory/pale shades in their foundations (other than that they are great, Mineral Inject and Papparazzi Perfect are awesome.) Another vote for paler shades, all your foundations are way too dark and orange for me, such a shame. I'd love it if the $20 price point applied to your products purchased in NZ Kmart & Farmers. Hi fans! Thanks for your lovely feedback. We'll pass this along to the team xx Have anyone broke out like me, ??it's suck a shame I love the price and ingredients . I might try paparazzi one! The paparazzi didn't really cover up my Freakles that. Much which other one should I try ;/ Hi Lisar! Try a foundation with more coverage, like our Fresh & Flawless Make-Up or Stayput Foundation. The key is to apply lots of thin layers and to blend each layer to get great coverage that isn't cakey looking. P.S. We love freckles, they're gorgeous! xx"

I even have two in this picture. Love the paparazzi effect one!! I have two, one with fuller coverage than the other. I alternate between the two, depending on the condition of my skin. 8! For when I tan, when I'm paler, fuller coverage and I like to mix some to get my perfect concoction! 0 :( I don't really have any. I can never find any that match my skin tone Absolutely none..! one for everyday and one full coverage i currently have one and usually i only have one at a time I have a Mineral Powder, Panstick, 2 BB creams, Pressed Powder and 3 other medium coverage Foundations in different shades. I reckon I'm all set! I have several - for day/night, different occasions, different covrrage, rtc I have a few foundations, but im really loving BB creams at the moment I have one and its this brand.. great coverage two i mix them together cause it matches my skin tone better the any of the others would on their own (if that makes sense) I usually stick to the same one as I know it works and what I want it to look like. If you ever stop making your pressed powder in the square case ill be ruined. Such a staple! Paparazzi perfect foundation is pretty great too. I have none! So glad I'm not the only person with eight different kinds...Paparazzi HD is my favourite Australis one. About 4 :s I struggle with matching my skin colour! I have tonnes of old ones but now I've found the right one I have 8 liquid types and a handful of presses/loose powders :) I'm still trying to find the right one that stays Just the one. But honestly now I tend to just go with tinted moisturiser or I'm currently loving BB cream! 10... 0.0 :P i use a bb cream for work tho :)  trial and error most of the time then it just sits there :/ cos i think what if I like it in the future? :) still haven't found the right one yet need to find a full coverage one that doesn't make me look cakey one... and i bought it to wear on stage i need a good concealer though It sounds excessive but I have 14, I need different shades for when I'm tanned plus I like to try different ones :) 9...that sounds like a lot! I own a lot but only use 2 foundations (one is lighter, the other has more cover) and tinted moisturiser or bb cream if I'm not wearing foundation. Fresh and Flawless liquid and I sometimes use Fresh and Flawless pressed powder as foundation! 2 liquids, 2 pressed powders, 2 loose mineral powders and a tinted moisturizer. usually i have 3 Hey there, Georgiana! Our best advice is to take a friend to your local beauty store, test out a few different shades fairly close to your skin tone and get your friend to help you pick :) 

Another trick is to buy your two closest shades and mix it to match... Works well if you get more tan in Summer and paler in Winter! xx"

Good quality facial moisturiser with spf cannot go past!!! I always moisturise then use a bb cream and let it""Set"" so to speak. Then I use a damp beauty blender sponge and use the bottom of it to dab/stipple my foundation on.I use a finger for my concealer and finish with a fine layer of pressed powder,then I do highlight/contour/blush. I find australis foundation work best for my skin,dont know why they just do. My fav is the one with the brush(cant remember the name)stayput(my current and a past fav) and PPHD foundation Primer and a good foundation brush :) A good buffing or stippling brush makes a big difference Taking the time to find the right one for your skin. And a good skin care routine so you have the best base you can. Skin specific primer, apply foundation with a brush, depending on the look im going for I select the brush and technique accordingly, buff if required, press foundation into skin with fingers so it looks more like skin and then place and buff powder to set. Spritz with finishing spray for all day wear and added hydration, sometimes I carry a purse pack to give my makeup a pick me up during the day :-) Primer and a really good brush. starting off with a clean base is a must for me. Your foundation can only do so much. Whats important is that your skin is clean, fresh, moisturised and primed before you even go near the concealers and foundations. I also like adding a little bit of highlighter on the highest part of my cheekbones and contouring with gel bronzer before i pop on my liquid foundation. This means i can have subtle definition to my features without going too OTT with contouring. Lastly, Australis finishing spritz and a light dusting of the ready set go powder finishes the look. Always apply it to clean, moisturised and primed skin for a smooth base. Use more than one type of foundation at a time. Different areas of the face may need different coverage (Skin is rarely the same all over) I use my stippling brush to blend it out! Cleanse & moisturise daily if not twice a day.. Primer, foundation- I tend to dampen my foundation brush just a tad it seems to do a better job(for me anyway) and def use pressed powder to set:)  Hydrate skin well 
Set make up with powder I exfoliate my skin first as I don't often wear foundation to give it a smooth base. And follow up with a moisturizer. Primer then i'll stipple on the foundation, using my clean hands after to smooth it all out and blend it into the skin to make it look more natural. Follow up with setting powder and i'm good to go! i go outside in the morning to see what the weather is doing. after sussing it all out, i apply my foundation outside on my verandah making sure i don't cake it on and so i match the daylight :) i do my skincare first and then apply my makeup I use the Australia's finishing spray as a primer when I'm out of primer and after I've finished my make up. Double duty! cleanse prime apply and blot using your Fresh and Flawless Pressed Powder! My all time fave product :) Amazing tips here, ladies! xx"

The best :) Will be buying this next week. I've been looking for this product for ages! BEST POWDER IN THE UNIVERSE! I have even got my friends hooked on this! And to me it's like the mac studio fix powder. But cheaper and better! And I have nearly run out waaaah :'( I love most Australis products, but found with this one the shades didn't go light enough :/ Why arent there any shaded for darker people? Lots of dark skinned people live in Australia. Aboriginals, people of african/indian/middle eastern descent and other similarly dark skinned people. OMG your pressed powder is the BEST!!! I use this everyday. Best coverage Love it :) It's been my #1 product for years! I adore it, never stop making it! xx The darkest shade of liquid foundation is 'golden tan' - this goes perfectly with my skin tone. However, the darkest shade of the pressed powder is far whiter than the golden tan. I find this incredibly problematic - if I put on that pressed powder, it looks like I'm trying to give myself a lighter skin tone (which I'm not, I'm just trying to even out  my skin). I find it really annoying that with the pressed powder range, Australis isn't catering to the section of the population who happen to be darker-skinned than the powder. Is there anything in the works to rectify this? I certainly hope so. All your makeup thus far has been amazing... but please don't overlook those of us who just weren't fortunate enough to be born white. i never use anything else, and i recommend it to everyone. NEVER stop making it please!!! :) Thanks so much for your feedback girls! Glad to hear you are loving our foundations.

I tried to wash my australis mineral powder brush with shampoo and when it dried it was yukky... how/what is the besy way to clean them? I use a sponge I use brush cleaner after every use. You can get wet and 'dry' brush cleaners great for sink or tissue use. Bacteria doesnt always give off a high hum factor...re using a foundation brush is just like turning your undies inside out and wearing them again :/ Baby shampoo works too. Hey there, Kirsty! We'd recommend making sure that you make sure you remove all traces of the foundation with the shampoo and then check that you're also rinsed out all traces of the shampoo. Reshape the brush and let it dry :) If that doesn't work, some companies also sell brush cleaner that are specially designed to do the trick! Baby shampoo works for me, gets everything out and doesnt hurt the brushes :) I wash after pretty much every use before my foundations seem to make it go weird anyway"

So true Lanah although its nearly impossible to find a foundation that will match someone white as snow with olive undertones >_< Liquid BB cream. mouse Definitely liquid :) Liquid BB cream and mattifying powder. I currently use Rimmel as your shades are too dark for my complexion and tone. Liquid and powder Mousse and powder :)  Liquid! But its hard too get natrual looking foundations these days that actually cover alot without looking caked up  Courtney i'd get off rimmel, they are one of the worst for animal testing. if they have to test on animals chances are they're using things that sren't meant to be on your skin. powder :) Mousse all the way :) liquid liquid Powder Liquid and powder Liquid Liquid and powder powder how much is the mousse ??

Don't get me wrong it is important to love the way you look and understand that no one is perfect but there is also nothing wrong with make up. Before and after picture needed before I believe I need to buy 4 products. makeup up is not always to cover up or change it is also a form of art... i'm a makeup artist ... please come and do my face I wear makeup everyday to work, have trouble finding the right foundation. Hi girls! Thanks for sharing your thoughts :) Just a reminder to stay positive - any negative comments to other fans may be deleted. 

Kathy, finding the right foundation can definitely be tricky! What type of skin do you have (oily, blemish-prone, dry, sensitive etc.) and what kind of coverage are you after (light, medium, full)? We'll see what we can recommend! xx"

Both but usually in store because you don't have to pay postage/shipping and you can test out the product. Online! The deals are better, the prices are usually cheaper (if purchasing from overseas like I do) and it feels like your birthday when your parcel arrives definitely mall - can swatch and test all the colours & textures rather than just guessing what it will look like Online On line! Australian retailers need to wake up and realize we can not afford their 300% mark up rate for products.

Liquid is just messy Liquid and pencil Pencil liquid on top lash, pencil water line dependz if its work  pencil or  with friends for night out liquid  Liquid :) Liquid :) Pencil ;) Pencil will always be my fave! pencil. liquid is waaay too messy liquid Pencil! I seam to get it everywhere when I use liquid Liquid and sometimes pencil 
The curve liner drives me mental lol I end up using it like a normal liquid eyeliner pen pencil Both. Liquid top lid, pencil on the waterline :) Gel liner and a mix of 2 pencils i have never used liquid but my sister has on me before Liquid definitely both Pencil for waterline and smokey. Liquid for winged and sharp lines. Pencil :-) Pencil Liquid. So much more easier. liguid pen there is awesome! i love it. Liquid! pencil Love pencil for day and Liquid for night Both :) liquid on my top eye lid and pencil on the bottom and corners :D Liquid isn't messy if you know how to use it. 
Pencil for waterline,liquid for winged and sharp lines. Liquid Pencil Both. Liquid for top, pencil for bottom Pencil liquid Both Pencil Liquid runs if you tear up no way I want to bleed eyeliner ;-) Liquid on top eyelids, pencil on bottom eyelids. Liquid by far! Liquid :-) liquid. Liquid all the way! It gives such a sharp edge and looks amazing Liquid! Both Liquid Pencil! definitely liquid :) Pencil Liquid! Liquid for a more sharper professional look and pencil for that more smoky, sexier look Defiantly liquid lasts all day :D  Pencil Pencil Liquid! Pencil Liquid! Best stuff Pencil Liquid Cake with a brush =/ Liquid Liquid Pencil!! Liquid :) Pencil but liquid for top only ;) Pencil! the liquid is the best $15 I've spent in my whole life, there are no other liquid liners like this. it is so much easier to apply than all other liners and it doesn't run out like other felt tip liners when you go over eyeshadow. so happy with the purchase. Pencil in a hurry, liquid when I've got more time. Pencil when I'm in a rush :p Pencil Liquid all the way! Pencil always smudges and runs! PENCIL,CANT DO LIQUID Liquid Pencil! Liquid on top & pencil on the bottom (: liquid eyeliner goes on good and stays on all day! Would have to be my most worn piece of makeup. pencil Pencil Pencil. Agree with pretty much everyone. Liquid on top, pencil on bottom.  Haven't tried the Curve yet but probably will soon - because Almay stopped making their felt tip pens - they were the best! Pencil Both r brilliant but i use the pencil more if i want fancy then its liquid Liquid pencil Liquid! Super clean lines and you can smudge if needed. Pencil Liquid 4 top pencil 4 bottom Liquid for my eye brows, pencil for my eyes :) LIQUID! Liquid :) Neither; gel is the best! Liquid Clarisse S-h Liquid, make a crisp wing and crisp line. :) love it. I like something in between, not too runny/painty and not the pencils unless they are of really good quality cause otherwise they tend to clump/smudge unevenly but those felt tip, easy apply ones are awesome! um both.. i aint putting liquid on my waterline... Penciil Has anyone used that liquid liner in the picture? The packaging makes it look pretty easy to use Both :) Liquid on top pencil on bottom Liquid Liquid. Top and bottom  Both :) liduid Liquid Pencil Liquid <3 Liquid Pencil Liquid both liner for the bottom and liquid for the top especially for the catseye... liner just doesnt look as dramatic :) Liquid metallic black. Think it's Rimmel. Love! Gel :P pencil :) Liquid!! Crayon pencil Pencil is easier but smudges liquid takes time and looks neater I only use liquid if its a special occasion pencil Liquid pencil....I stugglewith liquid Gel preferably but if not then definitely pencil :) pencil liquid gel is better i think, for the top anyway. then pencil for the bottom. both Pencil Liquid K J H G"

But dont put primer over matte out base....i remember a makeup expert once telling me to put primer over pore minimiser and mattifier i was like ok...but then i found out myself it increased oil, shine and breakouts!! I love this matte out! Works great on my nose and forehead. I use australis stay put foundation. It's not too think, which means your face still feels like normal after its on! I have not been able to find the Matte Out either.  Where is it available? Oooooo when is Matte Out being released in NZ?! I maaaay have to jump on it when it arrives! Oh yay...I will def head to one of these shops to get some soon!!
Chelsea May...check this out!!!"
2013-07-16 12:19:09,Picking the right foundation = something every girl needs to master! Always check to see if your skin is more yellow or pink toned in natural light... then pick a foundation shade with the same undertones as your skin.,photo,,90,14,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Where on my face do I check for the skin colour tone? Awesome thank you, I have your 14 hour one, I will test that Went into priceline for help finding the right colors for my face and was told to just ""pick whatever"".  the bottom one as the top one can be abit orangey near the neck I would, but nowhere seems to have foundation light enough for my skin. So I actually have to use mineral powder mixed in with talcum powder. Try Myer Ashleigh, I have the most pale skin and I use their Clinique anti-blemish makeup and get 01 Fresh Alabaster. It's perfect :) True same here its not pale enough plus not even yellow understone If anyone can suggest a good yellow based one that would be great i have tan/olive skin, i gave up on finding a foundation, i just use a tinted moisturiser now Actually, it's important that your face blends with the rest of your body as some people can have redness in their face for example but their neck, hands etc are more yellow, so sometimes you want to neutralize the redness or sallowness somewhat.  Check out Lisa Eldridge's series on foundation on YouTube. It's brilliant! Actually... They are now saying to match your face and dï¿½colletage....because your neck is the whitest part of your body and can make you look ghostly... Match your foundation with your chest. Your neck doesnt get alot of sunlight."

Nope, don't watch it! Ridiculously sad! ;-; Billie should have died instead. Bad writing Forgot to watch it bloody night shift ;( Gutted!! But what incredible performances. This show is so good. I work checkout at a supermarket, & I literally had young women coming in to buy chocolate cause they were upset about that episode. Omg.  Did not want him to die he is my fave character besides nina. Why!! Patrick died what Meh I didn't particularly like Patrick, but wow the performance by these actors was perfect. You feel so sad for Nina, not only has her sister gone off the rails, but she loses her partner and is going to have to raise the baby as a single mother. I expected her to go in to labour any moment during that episode just from the stress and shock! Great episode! They picked the wrong character to get killed off....Billie should of died.....too sad, Patrick was the best! I cried so much Saddest episode ever! To sad Sooo sad"

But usually, i do foundation first. Foundation and then concealer. But concealer under foundation for extra coverage on blemishes. Foundation first :) Primer then foundation then concelor under the eyes Foundation definitely :) have to brighten those damn circles under eyes haha Foundation first, then I can see if I need to apply concealer :) foundation foundation. sometimes thats enough to fix any imperfections. Foundation first then concealer foundation then concealer 
your not going to conceal much if you put foundation over the top Concealer first then apply foundation Foundation This has changed my life. I thought there was only one way to do it. Primer then put foundation n then see where concealer is needed :)) Foundation, concealer then set with powder. primer, foundation, concealer then setting powder. i have that foundation haha Foundation, then you know what areas need concealed and avoid caking on too much product. Foundation then concealer foundation then concealer. foundation! way i was taught in beauty college Primer, concealer then foundation. Cause my concealer is the green one? Foundation foundation, concealer then ready set go finishing powder and I am off lol Primer, colour correction, foundation, concealer, setting powder :) Primer, Foundation then concealer  Foundation Primer foundation just in case I don't need concealer! Foundation unless Its powder foundation foundation then concealer Foundation, councler and then powder foundation on top! Foundation first I agree, foundation then concealer. :) Bb cream foundation then i use concealer to highlight under the eyes then set with a trans powder = a flawless coverage and keep my face moisterised with bb to prevent drying or breakouts on the skin :) Im a yellow undertine plz do in tht shade range in this foundation i love it but can't use it due to the color shade plz plz do it in like loreal w1 shade or like palest pale yellow undertone like estee lauder double wear in shade bone Concealer.... Concealer Foundation, if you apply concealer on top of your foundation you get a lot more coverage & it blends out easier :) Concealer. If its a green/purple/salmon concealer than I'll apply that first. If its a beige concealer I'll apply it afterwards I thought you had to do concealer first because when blending you would rub off the foundation if it was already on.  I see now most do it the other way. I do a bit of each depends how I feel at the time Foundation Concealer to hide certain things. Bags under eyes. Scars etc Foundation Concealer then foundation. Works for me! Do a ""Zorro"" mask over the eyes of concealer, then apply foundation everywhere and touch up with concealer at the end. Works a treat for dark circles. Foundation ;) foundation first and concealer next. You will ruin the texture if you put concealer on first"

I like having bronzed face, arms and legs. #1: Beyoncï¿½ #2: Lauren Conrad #3: Selena Gomez  <3 I love being bronze as it looks waaaay better than being pale white, it looks healthy and glowing and is the perfect look not just for summer but all year round. :D 1 BEYONCï¿½ , 2 LAUREN CONRAD , 3 SELENA GOMEZ

I like to be a little bit fake bronzed because I really can't get a tan from the sun and am very sun-conscious BUT I do like to look like I've actually been outside during the summer! Beyonce, Lauren Conrad, Selena Gomez.  I like to wear bronzer because I'm too sun conscious to tan in sun, it makes your skin age!  1:Beyoncï¿½, 2:Lauren Conrad, 3:Selena Gomez.

Lauren conrad, Jennifer Lopez and ciara ;) i love being bronzed because it makes you glow, when you glow you look pretty xx Beyonce, lauren conrad & selina gomez -bronze is the ulitmate way to define, highlight, darken and enhance your skin! rather be bronze then burnt and crispy Beyonce, Lauren Conrad and Selena Gomez! I love to be bronze cause I look better and healthier, and glamorous! 1) is Beyonce, 2) is Lauren Conrad and 3) is Selena Gomez!

As a fair-skinned, blonde, freckled gal, you can count on finding me lathered in sunscreen rather than sun tan lotion!  I'd love to sport a radiant, tanned, sun-kissed glow - but alas, with my complexion this is not my fate. I'm super duper thankful that companies such as Australis Cosmetics make it so easy to fake that just-finished-holidaying look with AMAZE products such as their bronzer and highlighter! Thanks Australis for making me feel like (but not-as-tan-as) Beyonce and look my best ever! Bring on fake bronze for summer! :D Beyonce, Lauren Conrad, Selina Gomez.  I love to be bronze and its the next best thing after gold! Beyonce, Lauren Conrad, Selena Gomez. I like being Broze cause it looks so much better than white! Makes you look healther, slimmer and gives you a glow :) Beyonce,lauren conrad an selena gï¿½mez..I wouldnt want to win for myself im a maori so naturally tan all the time lolz. But i have an irish friend who is pale and has gone back to ireland her name is Sessy Wyles to be honest irish people need all the help they can get.. no.1 - Beyonce, no.2 - Lauren Conrad, no.3 - Selena Gomez, I love being bronze because it makes my chubby cheeks have defined bone structure. It also makes an illusion of a slimmer nose because I have inherited my mum's asian nose. I just love being bronzed because it helps me feel confident and feel glowing! Beyonce, Lauren Conrad, Selena Gomez, I love being bronze it gives me confidence :) Pm sent. Will be In others folder :-)"

Loved the last 2 years xmas cards, stunning ! I do not hate the k's but I think $250,000 is out of whack just for a xmas card. Seriously? Ridiculous and it's not even Christmassy.. Also illuminati symbol in the first pic Rubbish and completely void of class and not even close to resembling Christmas. Ridiculous....like everything to do with them! Illuminati Yuk :) They all look so unhappy. Christmas photos are supposed to be fun and warming. This has nothing to do with Christmas. They'll look back at this and think 'we suck' lol ;) ""Oh my God it's the Illuminati symbol in the back!"" You do realise that symbol is also on American currency? This tends to coincide with the money signs and the fact that these women are loaded. Not everything has to be a conspiracy. Crap!! Wut. Not even anything to do with christmas! Stupid. Hate. It's got the kardashians on it Im a big fan of the photographer. His work is amazing..if I can afford it why not. Illuminati? Illuminati bitches. This makes me sick, it's all about showing how rich and ""above"" everyone else they are. Christmas is supposed to be about family values, not pure materialistic bullshxt. Perfect example of how society has lost it's way. Everything is about money and looking good. Appalling!! HATE! Money and illuminati symbolism, hmmm yes very Christmassy -_- The set was amazing. Kylie looks great! Trash Is there such thing as ""Rich Bogan??"" If not the Kardashians just invented it! Love the kardashians :) There's nothing Xmas about this pic? A shocking and disgusting display of waste, should have gone to those in need and they could have had a friend take a better picture for free. Totally obscene.. and not even a good picture either! I don't like it... It's not even Christmas themed..."

The man who had m kidnapped me shot me with his gun until I was gone. I was never found beacause he locked my body in the attic, then left it to decay. I week later, I returned. Soon I found him and got my revenge. You have10 minutes to post this to 20 pictures. Examples: A teenager named Emma read this and did'nt belive it. She laughed, closed her computer, and continued with her day. That night i grabbed a knife from her kitchen and stabbed her to death. I shoved her bloody body deep into her shed. Then there was Thomas, (he was only 12 years old) He read it and freaked out a lil, he posted it to 11 coments,rookie mistake. Now every night when he's sleeping I give him the scare of his life, he should be scarred right now. Then the last one, Kim,she is a smart one. She got scared and posted this to 20 comments, as told. Now every night after she falls aleep I make sure she is okay. So if u want to live, post this to 20 comments in 10 minutes, good luck! You time starts in 3,2,1"

Always ready for touchups during the day and lasts longer than other products. Making me look fresh on hot summer days :) can't live without My Australis handbag essentials are the Fresh & Flawless pressed powder and the concealer stick for any touch-ups during the day. I really like that the powder has an in-built mirror, means I can check out my face any time, any where! (How vain, hah!) The concealer is small and compact and the same size and shape as a lippie so it fits anywhere in my bag. I also like to carry around my Color Inject Lippie in Disco - it's a colour that really suits my skintone. It brings a lot of warmth and colour back to my face if I get stuck anywhere with bare lips! The Lip and cheek combo is at the top of my ""must haves"" I love products that are compact and do 2 things in one :) Lip and cheek combo, saving space in my handbag by combining the two products! Genius! 1. the australius tinted moisturiser is amazing it feels better then your normal moisturiser and has amazing coverage and it fits perfectly in any bag, not to big not to small -                      2. the Velourlips Matte lip cream is also perfect it is very creamy but it does not crack or make you lips feel dry and the colours stay on for almost the whole day - no need to top up 500 times  -                                                                         3. Multi Mega Lash its ama-zing its way better then any other mascara and even better it stays for as long as the lippy and it comes off without to much work and it also takes quite awhile before it runs out which is great :) fresh and flawless powder to touch up during the day, such a life saver and just the basic black pencil eyeliner because it is honestly the best pencil eyeliner ever, super pigmented and I've been through about 8 of them (one for my bathroom, one for my bedroom, one for my handbag, one for my schoolbag etc) :) I would love to win this because a) it comes with a pink bag, who doesnt want a pink bag?! b) I've only tried a few australis products which I have loved and want to try more of the fantastic range which I'm sure is as amazing c) It would legitimately make my year d) I just love australis :) such an amazing brand! Good luck to everyone else x Handbag essentials are velour lips! They stay in good. Also twista sista mascara, angled liner brush and very black eyeliner for touch ups.

I would create an all in one product that had mascara, eyeliner and eyeshadow. One end would be the mascara, the other the eyeliner and eyeshadow ;)  Because I am lazy when it comes to applying eyeliner but not so bad about mascara and eyeshadow :) I'd create a BB cream with built in bronzer which also has sunscreen protect and added moisturiser so your skin can look Sun kissed without the damage it would also be natural and animal cruelty free,  with a primer base that acts like glue keeping it on your face on even the hottest days - too much? Lol A tool to create the perfect cat eye winged eye liner Make up that covers wrinkles, mascara that makes your eyelashes grow, lipstick that has diamonds in it and an liquid eye liner that lasts longer :) A perfect eyeshadow tool that has all the different colours in it and when u click a coloured button it will turn to the colour u want because im really bad at putting  eye shadow on amd I dont have all the colours xx plz a mascara and eye liner that don't smuge and can be affordable to one and all If I had no limitatons, I would create a machine that did your make up for you and you could choose what kind of make up you wanted eg. Full coverage with a smokey eye for a night out or a light natural look for a casual day!  Like those magic eye strips where you swipe across the eyelid and it applies the pre-set shadow for you....A giant one of those that does all of your make up for you. Eyes, foundation, eyebrows and lips all in one go...If only! Duochrome eyeshadow that stays on without eye glue or primer that you could make to your nailpolish!!!!!! It would be perfect for matching your eye colour as the duo chrome could be complementary like a dark purple with a green shift! Glitter eyeshadow that doesn't leave speaks everywhere <3 definitely something that made it super easy to do perfect winged eyeliner that doesn't rub or come off with water etc... Every girls dream :P I magic applicator that can take a pic (say out of a magazine) of whatever eye make up you want and wave it over your eyes and it magically comes out exactly like the pic (o.O) A gel eyeliner that drys super fast and doesn't smudge!!! A makeup line that suited every skin type, no matter if you had super oily or super dry skin, it would work perfectly on everyone :) a stick on contouring kit! which tells you what face shape you have and has the contouring in the ""right places"" prepared for you already. AND a compact that has the contouring kit, a concealer, foundation, primer, eye liner, mascara, lippy, bronzer and blush all perfected to your own colour (mix and match before you buy). I would invent a spray bottle  that all you need to do is spray like a must then BAM instant awesomeness!! Eyes face and lips done! Would charge hundreds for it too and available in many colours and glitz etc haha A eyebrow kit where it plucks your eyebrows into perfect shape for you and then finds the exact colour that will go perfectly with them. Heaven! Or self applying nail polish so you never screw them up again! No limitations? At all? One foundation that matches flawless on any skin type and color. I say this because I just got a Mac foundation that everyone raves about but it slides around my face and I'm so SAD. 

Also, I'd create some kind of magic.. eye liner that does all the drawing for you. I'm kind of blind in one eye and can't to wings on one side of my face because I can't see out of the opposite eye! So frustrating! i would creative an eyeliner at one end and a mascara at the other that would be awesome(; I would create a magical foundation that would adapt to any skin tone once you applied it. The foundation would make you look like you had drunk lots of water, eaten all of the healthy things and had the best sleep ever- basically your skin would glow with health...I need this in my life! Foundations & Powders with spf protection and moisturiser to keep skin youthful. :) The ultimate dewy highlighter to make everyone look like they had angel cheek bones :) A foundation that also firms and lifts skin A lippy that will stay on your lips all day with out applying it all the time and it wont mark your wine glasses!!that would be bliss I would create a one of a kind makeup of each thing like mascara, eyeliner etc that is flawless and suitable for every skin type... No matter what comes in contact with the makeup it stays as it should...no touch ups required :) and it would make the best facial features stand out :) It'd involve some pretty amazing technology, but...

I'd start with a computer program where you take a picture of yourself, then you adjust the image to add in makeup and show how you want to look. Once you're happy, you transmit it to a special brush that has sensors on it.

As you move the brush over your face, the sensors detect where they are in relation to the image you took earlier and they apply the makeup required to make you look like you wanted to with the makeup!

You could choose all sorts of crazy things and change them each day, and all the hard work would be done on the computer rather than squinting into the mirror and trying to do the perfect winged liner for the 5th time in a row. One that stalls the age lines and blemishes! Magic lipstick that changed colour, sort of like a mood ring haha a mascara that actualy puts on fake eyelashes tgat at the end of the night peel off The ultimate illuminator/bronzer in one liquid product with the ultimate applicator that has multiple applicators to suit all face shapes. One that would make contouring for even the most novice make up dabblers easy <3 because contouring and highlighting is so important and complimentary to all faces! Lipstick that doesn't rub off onto coffee cups/wine glasses/food and stays on all day without flaking and drying (: something that would give you whatever eyeshadow look you're going for and you can change the colour or style instantly without having to start again. also easy to remove instant perfect smudge-proof winged eyeliner! because it takes soo long to get it perfect! nail polish that will never get ruined! the amount of frustration doing my nails and it gets ruined. this was my 2 hour morning the other day resulting in me taking it all off and giving up! Patches that have the same pigmentation characteristics and textures as skin so that when you have a blemish on your face that sticks out like a sore thumb, it camouflages it. It would be really lightweight, like skin! ALSO, a sort of palette that allowed you to mix shadows... For example, get all the basic shadow colours you need and then shimmer and glitter etc so you could create any eyeshadow look with any colour or finish that you wanted. Automated liquid eyeliner....cos I always stuff it up doing it myself!!! :( A brush tat with one swipe on the face everything is blended perfectly, I hate sitting there blending everything out it takes toooooo loooonnnngggg so I want a magic brush that does it instantly. Oh how dreams are free :p x A tool/pen that has buttons on it so you can instantly change the colour to what colour makeup you want. Or a nail polish that never dries (in the bottle) An eyebrow pen that just senses the colour of the hair and just makes them perfect! Perfect shape, arch and everything else <3 A foundation that adapts to your skin colour :) It sounds strange but some kind of product that gives the illusion of hair . Iv ruined my eyebrows from over waxing plucking <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0094>. Sometimes drawing them on doesn't have the same effect so a product that you can apply almost the same concept as the mascara that comes with the white lengthening primers but for your eyebrows to give illusion of thicker brows <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D> A liquid eyebrow gel that dries into a wax, so it sets itself and you don't have to have a million products to have perfect eyebrows :) Definitely an eyeshadow pallet that you buy, and choose three eyeshadows you thoroughly enjoy to slot in. Then it would have 6 other slots for eyeshadow but they're like a mirror.. And then those mirror ones can turn into any colour eyeshadow you can imagine, so you can use those colours and any combination without having to have a hundred different pallets in your makeup drawer. I would create a foundation that could be lifted /peeled off at the end of the day taking all my other makeup with it. I would create a liquid eyeliner that could do rainbow liner when you applied it so you could always have the perfect rainbow liner!! nail polish that actually lasts for months and does not clip or come off- even shellac does! Waterproof foundation. That matches your skin
Tone perfectly I would love a brush/tool that would apply foundation, powder and blush perfectly and quickly!! Especially with the emphasis of hiding my tired bags <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0084> Eyeliner that created the perfect cat eye everytime! Spray foundation, but it would be all things perfect and easy to use; lightweight, full coverage, dewy or matte finish depending on their preference, and would come in every shade to suit every skin tone and have a mini concealer dabber at the top! That would be a dream haha. A nail gloss that sealed my fave colours so that it didnt chip off at work. Then I can see my pretty nails for days while I'm working with my cows! Also agree with a liner that does perfect cat eyes ;-) I would create a mascara that gave you eyelash extensions at the same time :) A mascara that doesn't smudge when you sneeze straight after applying it I would create nail polish that you'd need to just dot on your nail, then it would spread evenly until you have a perfect manicure. Once it dries, it would be completely chip proof! A nail polish that changes colour depending on my mood :D oh oh and it should never come off <3 Single swipe eyeshadow that immediately creates day then dramatic night effects!  I would just love to have my own makeup brand. Not all these super inventions. Makeup is art and I would have my own store with every girls dreams in it haha Im totally working on this for marketing at uni. Lol I would create a makeup brush cleaner that collected the yuck makeup off your brushes and blended it into an eyeshadow or concealer depending what brush your cleaning. Nail Polish that separates magically into rainbow colours!! You know how you get those nail polishes which look, say, blue in one light, and green in another, and gold in yet another? WELL, I would want to somehow do that, but with a lipstick in a red/pink/gold colour - with the same flawless shine too! A somewhat of a in styler for your eyelashes.a tool that curls your eyelash supper easy and fast. Without the kinks of traditional lash curlers. Also a bunch of lip liners where the pen has multiple colours (take of the bottom and insert it at the top) to use different colour. I'd call it rainbow lip crayons. Great for doing ombre lips with out the fuss A foundation that is one shade suits all as its so annoying trying to find a shade that matches. Also a lipstick that has small scanner on the other end. To scan any colour!!! And therefore a lipstick that could be any colour. (Apparently there is a pen that can do this) A concealer/foundation set that are actually perfect for my paleness!! The perfect foundation for my skin that covered all the imperfections but looked completely natural. I would make an eyelid brush that holds like 3 colours in it and you only hafto squeeze the handle to fill the brush up so when u brush it on your eyelid you have 3 colours that come out and onto your eyes smoothly and exact.. So you could have black closer to your eye lash, a grey in the middle and a white up near your eyebrow :) Self- cleaning makeup tools and brushes A super mascara that would make your lashes super long and super thick and super dark. It would be super water-proof to the point where it would wipe away your tears like little windscreen wipers and make it all better. And would be super easy to take off, it would just glid onto the tissue or makeup wipe like a black swan's perfect water landing. And it would smell like vanilla heaven.What was the question again? I'd make some form of hair concealer, so that on those days when you haven't got enough time to shave your armpits, or legs, (or any other areas!) you could slap on the hair concealer and it'd look silky smooth! A foundation that has a bottle that can scan for your skin tone and then turns into the colour of your skin tone. Or at least a foundation that changes into your skin tone colour. Perfect foundation is so hard to find!! An all in one make up! Once you put it on, then BAM! there's your face all done up cause you've already put on the foundation, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick etc.. all in that one application from that one make up container! smudge proof eyeliner An eyeliner stamp. So you could do perfect eyeliner every time by simply stamping it on. Forget about wobbly lines and uneven eyes! Brilliant yes? I'd create foundation that just photoshopped my skin into perfection. No caking, no getting oily half way through the day, and it would cover my imperfections without covering me like a mask <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C> Eye brow stamp it perfectly fills in your eyebrows <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D> Lipstick which last ages and is a mood changing one but all the colours it changes to are pretty colours A miracle makeup item that did everything for you a lippstick pen that colours your lips any colour perfectly at the tap of it to your lips For me it would be a primer that filled in your pores. But It was permanent? I have quite large pores and after a while makeup settles into them.. So a permanent pore filler! a foundation that works as a sunscreen moistouriser base coat, concealer, does face contouring, and bronzing all in one hit. A permanent foundation... Not creative, but just being real!!! I would create a eyeliner and mascara all in one. It would be liquid eyeliner. That way instead of carrying both around you can have them both in the same thing and more portable. A magic contour spray! Contouring takes so much time, it would be so much easier to spray it on and have it blend perfectly! Blush stain.. Lasts up to 1 month! A all in one thing weir you would push a button the makes the eyeliner come, then push the button again that adds the lipstick and so on!!! :) Eyeliner like those multi colour pens, press the colour you want :) Eyeshadow that looks like Glitter and that stays on. Waterproof mascara that actually does what it says it'll do  A nail polish spray that sprays on any design that you would like over any base colour! It would have settings to choose from like cheetah print, zebra stripes, polka dots etc! :)  Omg I had this conversation with my fiancï¿½ a couple days ago. It's not a makeup product as such but. I wish like once a year you could get an injection of any type of perfume. It would become your ""natural"" scent on your skin. I have such trouble with perfume lasting throughout the day. My injection would be flowerbomb, by the way. ;) I'd probably design a line of facial sprays that automatically just spray all your makeup on perfectly in like five seconds. There'd be different ones for different looks you wanted. And they'd smell nice. Like chocolate or something. Mmmm. A eyebrow gel that adapts to your skin tone and brow hair AND a eyeliner that changes with time (becomes darker as it is exposed less to light) :D OR a nail polish that changes colour according to your mood...?! How cool would that be?! a foundation, that not only sets as a lightweight mask, but also, when you peel it off, pulls out all your blackheads and clears you pores. As a mua Ive always wanted to create a flawless foundation that goes on with no colour then adapts to your skintone !! Byebye makeup lines and orange faces hooorah!!!perfect for girls just starting out too :) A serum to vanish wrinkles. A really pretty almost 3d holographic eyeshadow I would create a one foundation that everyone could use and it would match every skin type A big cat themed eye shadow which could allow a girl to have a crazy bold pattern, either tiger, leopard or jaguar. Just because why not it would be really cute & fun! A make-up gun like that time on The Simpsons! Mascara That dyes ur lashes Any colour!! Bright blue,  purple, black, white, pink etc! =] I would create a machine/robot that did your makeup perfectly each day, you would just tell them what you wanted to look like and the machine would do it for you <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0085> A stencil that helps you obtain perfect contouring of the face, for each face shape, with a kit containing all the products you need to achieve the final result. liked and shared :)  A twenty-four blush on that stays on the cheeks so at the end of the day you still look perfectly blooming :) A super-mascara that you could use at home for special occasions that would make your eyelashes so long and full that you would not need extensions, it would be long lasting and smudgeproof- but easily removed with a special remover formulated to remove it gently! :) A full collection of perfecting makeup that covers every wrinkle, freckle, spot etc & leaves the wearer with perfect looking airbrushed skin ;) The longer it's used for - the better your skin will become :) And it goes on idiot proof, so if we do it wrong - it'd correct itself!  Dreams are free lol I'd create an everyday makeup mask that you can apply at night (it'd have moisturising properties like a face mask also), peel off in the morning, and make up is done and good to go! Would save me from missing the bus so many times! Makeup made easy for lazy girls. :) plus added bonus of moisturisation! I would create paint on false eyelashes couple of swipes with a mascara type brush and done! And also mini hair straightners that plug into the cigarette lighter in your car ! A foundation to make my oily blemish prone skin look flawless. or a mascara that really did double the length of my lashes. What happened to your Lent! A mascara that gives you that smokey eye finish.  So much time wasted trying to achieve the look when i could be doing other things. I would create a nail polish that changes colour (contains every colour under the sun!) and changes once each day so that you wouldn't ever get sick of the colour on your nails! It would also not chip and be super easy to apply, if you got any on your skin it would just magically disappear! It would also be really easy to remove and comes off straight away by using some nail polish remover :) I think this would be such an exciting product as you would go to sleep every night, eager to find out what the next days colour will be! :D An under eye concealer that covers your dark circles but while wearing it your bags are reduced and it works on removing dark circles for good! A special make up mist spray that prevents make up wearing off during the day and ads a glow to your skin, ranging in different hues of colour depending on your skin tone. A foundation that only came in 3 shades & completed fit your skin tone! No more trailing heaps of foundations & having to buy a few for different seasons! Had good coverage & would last the full day without touch ups. A girl can dream, right? a foundation that makes every blemish disappear but you can't see the make up itself and you don't have to re-apply for two days Magic eyeshadows that instantly matches the shades of your outfit A miracle eyeliner- because it's all in the eyes and I think most ladies have a hard time getting it right... :) face tatoo pens A foundation that ""actually"" covers and smooths your skin out completely hiding bumps ect. ,  but at the same time works as a moisturiser , toner , is healthy and makes you feel fresh not cakey <U+2661><U+2665> Makeup that magically dissolves off of your face when you want to take your makeup off A clear foundation that transforms into the shade of your skin and gives you a nice glow. Stays on for longer and protects your skin from the sun :) Mine would be a foundation that doesn't get affected by sweat!! Even the best foundations sweat off of me and it's so upsetting I just need a magic foundation that withstands sweat please and thank u paua coloured nail polish Eye Shadow primer that can't crease, ever. Eyeliner tracer to keep your flicks even A lipstick with gloss and chapstick included all in one :) I would make foundation that is moisturizing for dry skin, and it would be warm toned (yellow base) for ethnic women. Im talking about Asian and Indian women here. An eye liner that changed colour with your mood. Mascara that tints your lashes & brows and makes them grow thicker the more you use it! I would make an all day lasting foundation that automatically adjusts to cover and suit your blemishes and skin tone. That would be a life saver for anyone!! Glossy lip balm that would stay looking glossy throughout the day without having to reapply it! A lipstick/lipgloss that is magnetically repelled to getting on your teeth! :p no limitations?  A moisturiser that can reverse all signs of time and keeps your skin ss beautiful and as soft as a babys!! I would create pliable makeup masks, that would come in a multitude of looks so that I would never have to worry about applying makeup in a rush. I would just choose my look, put it on and look fabulous ;) a product that shapes and fills in your brows at the same time XD Id create a foundation that adapts to your skin tone so you'd have no awkward blend lines or bad lighting situations and it wouldn't look cakey c: Make up you can wear at school and teachers cant see it A foundation that you could spray on and it goes on perfectly evenly, not shiny and matches your complexion perfectly."

See the pic below for details!,photo,,82,56,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"A foundation that somehow stains your skin to the perfect coverage...covers all the imperfections... but lasts a few days like self tanner... but is good for your skin so it will be fine leaving it on overnight lol... or a liquid eyeliner that stains the liner into place for a few weeks Lip dye. To stain lips for 24 hrs. Special remover required. A liquid eyeliner that applied itself. Like an automatic thing that you don't actually control. Haaate applying winged eyeliner. So hard Something that gave you perfect winged liner. Everytime! lipstick that only comes off when you want it to! A concealer with plenty of pigmentation to cover blemishes and dark under eye circles and can be used as a lippy color or base A liquid foundation that applies perfectly and matches your skin tone automatically. A foundation that prevents an oily ness showing until you remove it. Every foundation I've tried that is good for oily skin always ends up showing a bit of oil by the end of the day a foundation that would match your skin tone once it set so you wouldnt get makeup lines Eyeliner that does not smudge up the top in the creases of your eyes but would wash away easily. An eyeliner that automatically creates symmetrical wings so you dont have to spend hours evening them up every morning! The perfect contour cream that blends into your foundation, almost like a cream bronzer with minimal shimmer. My perfect product! a foundation that made your skin flawless, and you didn't have to take it off and it didn't rub off so your skin always looked that perfect ;) An airbrush foundation that works just like photoshop! I would make a foundation that had a coating so i could touch/rub my face and it would rub off on my hands or clothing ! :) Matt finish CC Cream with SPF30 A lipstick you apply that has the effect of ombrï¿½ lips and changes colour with your mood . make up that lasts forever, one application and set for life haha Make up that no teachers can see just you and people around you so you can wear as much make up as you want at school matte bronzer in a variety of shades and undertones..its hard work finding the perfect one! Waterproof natural white eyeliner because natural = good and white eyeliner never stays on long enough I would totally create something to make my 27year old face with lines look 18years old with no lines!!!! Eyebrow Falsies! Saves having to groom and define every morning, not everyone is blessed with thick eyebrows I think you guys have it covered but id love to  create a perfect matte shadow palette xx Something that even I can't sweat off! I hardly wear makeup because I sweat way too much :( All day Long lasting foundation.....as mine never seems to stay on all day ombre lipstick <3 A brush with blusher colour and contour bronzer colour on each half, so you could blush and contour/bronze at the same time. Also maybe detachable brush heads for different colours of blush and bronzer! Two in one mascara and eyeliner Mascara and eyeliner in one! Smokey eyes and a bright red lip Lipstick that lasts perfectly untill you wash it off. Makeup that won't budge unless you want it to -.- A matte liquid eyeliner pen that won't budge Liquid Eyeliner that went on perfectly everytime! Well we our all beautiful people so we dont even need make up :D but if I could I would make a lipstick on one end a shimmer gloss on the other end xxx I'd create a GENUINE oil eliminating foundation :) A foundation which made your skin look perfect without making your u look caked... The perfect colour i would create a sealant for around my lips so no lipstick would smudge off it and also would have the perfect shape! Brush-on synthetic Eyelashes in a single mascara wand tube Lipstick that changes colour depending on the lighting - so in natural light your lipstick would adjust to a tone that is flattering in that light, in artificial light it may become a little darker and richer, and in night-time artificial light (like in a club or restaurant) it would adjust to a dark night-time colour.  This would mean you only need to carry one lipstick around for day to night and different environments! A mineral powder with a build-able coverage ! I love wearing mineral powder but sometimes it just doesn't do the trick would be amazing to get one powder that let's you have a light/medium/full coverage ! :)) An instant fine line eraser or a self blending foundation! An instant whole face makeup gun, like Homer Simpson made for Marge but that works a LOT better haha A nail polish that never chips, goes on perfectly, doesn't need base or top coat, only takes one coat, dries instantly, can magically change colour to what I want as often as I want and makes my nails grow! :) Something that makes your skin healthier when you wear it. A foundation, concealer, bronzer and highlighter all in one I would love to create a blush that when applied dry was one colour and when applied wet was another! Choices are great when you get sick of the same look every day :-) A concealer that makes your acne disappear straight away! A lippy that perfectly places itself into the shape of your lips giving you a sharp defined pout that stays all day :) Lipstick which changes with your moods like a mood ring for your lips, you are feeling sexy, it's be red, flirty: hot pink, shy: soft pink etc An eyeshadow that didn't sink in to the lines of my eyes and make my wrinkles more obvious and also that didn't come off when I rub my eyes!"

Ends 19/06/2014. Full T&Cs: http://on.fb.me/TImKG7",photo,,708,587,60,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"I use a thicker lip balm and switch out my lipsticks to plum toned shades! The biggest change is really in skincare routine. Less is more, nice cool tones to suit the weather, but never making it look like it's painted on. I change my beauty routine by adding in more skincare and using different colour lipsticks and shadows Darker and more dramatic eyes,
With plenty of lip balm Extra hydration ï¿½ be it a heavier night time moisturizer, a hydrating serum, and having extra water. Lip balm becomes essential, I also stick to a nude palette for my face and choose darker nail polish shades :) I apply warm toned blush and lippy, then top it off with a sleek winged eyeliner A slightly paler foundation, and lipstick with more depth and vibrancy - all to cheer the chilly days. I have to moisturize like there is no tomorrow as i find winter dries me out. I also wear brighter colour lipsticks to brighten my day :) Lighter foundation, and more moisturiser! Winter makes your skin pretty dry. I live in FNQ so the weather here does not change drastically but if I am wearing gloomier colours like black and grey cardigans or jackets I like to brighten it up with brighter coloured make up or accessories. Red lippie and matching earrings are a fave. I use a rich moisturiser and heavier foundation because my skin isn't as clear in winter. More primer and moisturizer and illumizer to make my skin glow x I change my foundation from liquid to powder as my skin gets drier and use plenty of moisturiser. Change up to a fuller coverage foundation, bit mor highlight and brightening, change up of blushers and deeper lippies. I change from BB cream to foundation, and switch from lipgloss to lipstick for more intense, matte colour. Lighter foundation. i change my routine by using more moisturizing on my skin, using different colours of eye shadows,and always wear lipstick balm before applying the lipstick to have my lips well protected. My foundation becomes ghostly white because my summer tan fades, I combat that with bronzer and blush to add colour. I also don't have to use as much powder because I won't sweat as much. Bright red lipstick is my fave paired with dark mascara and eyebrows is the perfect winter look in my opinion :) moisturise regularly :) Lots of moisturising products and darker lips! (: x I tend to use a lighter foundation, pop on the grey and black eye shadows and bring out the pink lipsticks! I tend to use a lighter coloured foundation and cooler eyeshadow tones :) I also use a lighter moisturiser and more natural coloured lipstick/ lip balm I use more cream products because my skin is a lot drier and I like a more dewy look in winter. I wear more vibrant colours. I feel like being a bit different and rather then go for darker more sultry colours - bringing bright colours into my look :) A little bit of a heavier foundation with lots of illuminator. Bright matte lips and nude eyes :) got to add a little bit of colour to a dreary winter day! More Moisturizer && Light Foundation <3 My foundation stays the same cos I'm a pasty white girl all year round, but I choose darker eye colours for winter and use less products over all. i use a bold purple lipstick, australia velourlips in to-ki-o/ t-ok-io Using a hydrating serum under moisturizer and mixing some foundation into my moisturizer before applying my foundation for full coverage without caking! mosturise twice daily! it saves face! literally I really good lip balm is a must,  and green concealer to tone down my red nose haha Bold lips and darker eyeshadows A more moisturising primer, lighter foundation, a more pinky toned blusher an darker eyes or lips. The purple velourlips is my shade at the moment I use more blush on the cheeks instead of bronzer so my cheeks have a natural glow for this winter! Purple lipstick <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> for winter I use silver eyeliner as an essential instead of black <3 my nails also belcome lighter in colour while my skin is given that nude kinda look matched with the perfect black and white outfit most days <3 xxx I use more moisturizer and lip gloss to stop wind burnt look :) I use a darker lip color and don't really use much bronzer Well sadly I lose my tan I've worked hard all summer getting so a lighter foundation and I like to use more a pinky blush rather than a tan colour. Winter always makes me think of pink cheeks :) Moisturizer becomes heaver and make up much lighter! The cold wether naturally gives us all rosey cheeks so less makeup is needed, and winter is a fabulous excuse not to buy razors ;) xx  Flawless foundation, Dark red lipstick and brown smoky eye = taking over winter ! <3 In winter I just mix my concealer with my moisturiser to get a dewier finish to me skin, and layer my mascara so my eyes look even bigger Moisturiser, lip balm, moisturising foundation & darker nails! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098> by winning free stuff (pick me pls) Change my colours to warm browns with gold highlights. I tend to go for a darker lip colour, and loads of lip balm! As I usually colour my hair dark brown/ black during winter, my foundation routine becomes more flawless and pale and I also use more moisturised based products. I use darker products on my lips and eyes as it makes my blue eyes seem lighter and I also use darker colours to contour :) xo Moisturiser application increase, so does the lipbalm and lip repair creams. Dark lipsticks become priority and a thick concealer to cover my red little nose. Moisturise more and a dewy foundation! I tend to use more nude colours on the eyes and a warmer cheek colour!!! Apparently I'm the only person who doesn't change my routine I wear more natural tones in eyeshadow etc in winter I have to use a lighter foundation, lighten Down the bronzer or change to blush, neutral eyeshadow and lip tones, a lip moisturizer is a must have!! I moisturise religiously! :) Tinted moisturiser on top of moisturising primer on top of a moisturiser... Basically I add as much moisture as I can to stop my skin drying out and flaking in heated offices and it helps keep my makeup on and looking as fresh as the weather outside. Use a more intense moisturiser! <U+2764><U+FE0F> as my skin looks lighter i like to contour to give my bones a standout structure while using a nice dark colour pallete for eyes and lipsto give off a nude/tan look I use more moisturiser and less make-up and I cleanse more. During winter my routine changes completely! I moisturiser sooo much more and my foundation changes about 3 shades lighter as my summer tan is long gone<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00B0>! But my eyelashes remain bold and dark all year round <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+0080> some hydrating moisturizers to stop all the artificial warm air drying out my skin and some more neutral makeup tones to play up the colours around me I begin using more oils on my skin such as rosehip oil on my face and avocado oil on my body. I also use loads of carmex lip balm and for makeup I tend to focus more on a flawless base and a great contour and highlight! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> Lighter makeup less dark eyeshadows and more and more moisturiser Lighter foundation! Moisturize twice a day instead of once In winter I change my routine by: 
1. Using my nude eyeshadow palettes 
AND
2. Use lip balms that have a shimmer to them to bring some light to my face . 

:) I moisturize more and pile on more lip balm, especially at night. I don't tend to wear lighter foundation coz I don't change colour. I use a lighter hand when using bronzer and blush. I don't change lip colours cos I think just coz it's autumn/winter doesn't mean you can't brighten up the mood with a bright pink lipstick! Dark colours instead of brights. I love dark plum lipsticks my favourite is Australis grunge. I love me a good winged eyeliner and strong contoured cheek bones.<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><U+2744><U+FE0F><U+2614><U+FE0F> Heavy duty moisturiser and dark lip colours :* I wear a richer, moisturising foundation in cooler months to help protect my skin from drying out in the elements! Still make sure I wear a sunscreen product too :) Plus I tend towards moisturising coloured lip balms rather than matte colours which can sometimes dry the lips out! Definitely switch to more moisturising products to keep my face hydrated as the cold dries it out! Then also have to go with darker  but still simple eyes, plus bolder lips and brows <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008B> moisturiser moisturiser moisturiser! I moisturise a whole lot more especially on my face and i switch to a more dewy illuminating primer for under my foundation, also lots of pawpaw ointment for my lips! Moisturize the hell out of my skin In winter I use a dewy foundation that's more nourishing and moisturising. I also tend to be a little bolder with colours like a nice burgundy lip for a statement. I keep the rest pretty basic as the cold gives my cheeks a nice gentle flush. - Less is more and NOT a bore (moisturiser and primer as base before application of mineral BB cream)

- For day wear to mix it up I use a teeny-touch of rosy-pink blush on the apples of my cheeks. 

- Use of smokey eye in winter hues (darker browns, plums and bronzes)

- Eyeliner on the inner rim of the upper eyelid only just to accentuate the eyes and make them pop. 

- Finish with a slick of mascara. 

Done and dusted. Effortlessly chic and magnific *french accent* Lots of moisturizing and a lighter foundation Moisturise and lighter foundation. I use darker eyeshadow and a darker lip palette, all because I am a lot whiter in winter and darker colours compliment me more. I also moisturise more and wear my hair up more often aswell! Use warmer colours and moisturer more to keep my skin healthly Use a nice contour, highlight the eyes and cheeks for a brighter face and a nice plum blush and lipstick, or a pink nude lipstick :) Warmer and more neutral colours with extra blush for rosy cheeks as I tend to look more pale :) I've been highlighting alotttt to get back a glow haha I have to use moisturizing face masks more often or my skin dries out so much! And I also use night cream during the day as it's thicker. I love to mix it up more in winter I love exploring more with different coloured eye shadows & lipsticks. A fluffy winter's knit and darker lipstick is a match made in heaven. I use a moisturizer and a base and a lighter foundation as in the summer you tend to tan and have a darker completion.  Also wear more eyeshadow and eyeliner as the summer you seem to sweat your sweet make up off. Wear more lipbalm! I honestly don't even change my routine for winter, I just wear whatever makeup I feel like wearing on the day and my skin care routine is the same all year round. ~ Change my BB cream to a darker tone. A flawless sun kissed look this winter with out the sun = Win (y) ~ Lighter foundation ! More essential oils !
And lots of baths ! :-) I have normal to dry skin, so I'm always moisturizing before the application of makeup! I like to play with a lot of the dark colors like browns and plums and sometimes black! So i would do a nice golden or brown plumy smokey eye and match it with a dark bold lip! Or stay neutral with the eyes and bold on the lips, vice versa :))))) Use moisturiser to keep my skin healthy and darker colours on the lids and lips 
Rebecca Bittar where darker eyeshadow, nude coloured lip glosses and where more natural coloured blush and eyeliners :) have to keep up with the moisturiser though ALWAYS USE LENGTHENING MASCARA :) can't wait to win Rebecca Bittar thicker moisturizer, lighter foundation and darker lips! Hydration is in this season! Teamed with the perfect base primer before makeup application I can expect my makeup to last all day! Warm berry lipstick tones paired with sultry smokey eyes equals a perfectly elegant winter look :) It is important to keep skin hydrated by drinking plenty of water, using moisturiser, coffee scrubs and essential natural oils. Matching distinct outfits with lighter foundations and bold lipsticks and eyeshadows also helps create memorable looks! Lots of moisturizer!! I don't! I wear the beauty looks that I feel like wearing no matter what time of year it is. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> probably helps that I love in the tropics and we don't get a proper winter here haha Lip primer underneath my favourite lipsticks is now a must! I moisturise A LOT more.use a dewy primer instead of Matte. Use warmer blush colours and highlight more to bring a glow back to my face. I also love vampy coloured lippies (reds and plums) in winter too! Pale skin!
Deep red lipstick!
Blush blush blush!
And a matte over all finish of coarse! 
No other way xxxxxxxx

(: Neutral eyes, dark lips, moisturisers and serums for my lips! Also I drink lots of water so I stay hydrated and glowy from the inside :) I wear a warmer colour foundation in winter and hotter lip tones I wear darker berry colours all over for a winters feel!! Exfoliation is a must and I switch up my creams for something more nourishing because of my really dry skin. For makeup I also love playing with darker, richer tones on the eyes and lips in the cold weather:) Pale skin leads to lighter foundation and not to mention excessive amounts of moisturiser and lip balm!!! I have to apply a heavier moisturiser as my skin is drier and need a darker shade of foundation and i change my lip gloss from strawberry to berry, deeper shade for winter <U+2764><U+FE0F> Moisturiser but has to be tropical or coconut scented to remind me of summer x I use a good primer and moisturiser. For long lasting coverage and smooth soft skin! 
A lighter tone of foundation too :) 
I go for a nice rosey blush with a purpley pink lip to make the lips stand out :) 
For eyes i go for light brown shades and big lashes 
Simple but effective is key! Face masks I use heavier moisturisers as well as darker colours:) i have to moisturize my lips way more the crack really bad Hot baths with essential oils,moisturise more often and change my makeup colours to something a little warmer in colour :) Rhonda Lockery Darker lips, lighter blush & life supply of moisturiser Lighter foundation shade and dark lipstick! :) Moisturisers and lip balm! A good moisturizer and lip balm to keep my skin and lips looking great throughout the dry months. I don't wear foundations in winter cause they tend to dry my skin..
I love using moisturisers and face pack..
Also my go to winter makeup is red lips and some mascara 
Thats all :) My foundations become at least one shade lighter and I have to use more moisture intensive foundations. My makeup becomes more earthy and natural looking, and I tend to go for styles or looks that are durable rather than impact-making. I have to conceal more also usually around the nose and eyes especially when my sinuses play up. And lip balms are a must have everywhere I go! Thanks for the opportunity to win an amazing beauty pack! Good luck everyone :) I don't still wear sunscreen everyday, keeps my skin soft and moisturised Lighter shade of foundation and a good primer and my skin gets very dry. So lots of lip balm, moisturiser and love! Earthy and purple tones! Nothing much different... Less color nd mascara overload :] nd forever loving coconut oil for dryness! I put away the neon pinks and pull out the vampy colors and deep plums! Layering of moisturizer for face at night and at daytime lots of lip balm as my lips tend to crack then baby doll blush for my pale skin during winter. Lip balm, cool tone eyeshadow and lipstick, lighter foundation shade! Lots of moisturizer, & ruby red lips don't have to worry about sunscreen, cause you know its winter. so less sunscreen :) Lip balm and moisturiser ! All the moisturiser! Darker lip shade!! :) moisturizer ;) Lots of lip balm Good primer, foundation, translucent powder over top, peach blush, darker lipsticks, fill in eyebrows and some mascara. Sometimes i ditch the lipstick and use a good lip balm to keep my lips from getting chapped :) make up primer and then I use some bb cream foundation I like using a lot of soft colours that match my outfits in winter. But my little trick is to do a facial clense and a deep facial scrub always a good thing when winter hits. I also end up with a fabulous glow. I wear darker colours in winter like darker lips :) lots more lip balm and moisturiser!! I go for a more smokey eye in winter, and a deeper blush, I love changing my makeup up :D Fake tan hha! The cooler months bring cool kisses and blistering winds; therefore looking after my skin against the elements is vital. Not only do I change my face washes to sustain and create moister on my skin-keeling it healthy and hydrated. But my makeup becomes limited...working my simple bbcreams and few foundations. Letting my skin breath in the cooler times allows for fresh and rejoicing skin. Pastel lip colour and blush will always brighten up my day in the winter months.

Lip balm works wonders and a primer with added moisturiser :) I boost my moisturising in winter, my fave is slathering body butter on my feet, add a warm pair sox. Heaven! Lots of moisturiser, darker eyes, and fake tan I try to hydrate my face and body, and also brighten my complexion, my eyes,and my attitude to face the world when it gets real dark and gloomy! Good moisturizer, good primer, matte foundation, matte setting powder and not too light concealer :) Moisturizer, and am more open to wearing darker lips and eyes. Very keen to try the velourllips range :) Lip balm and moisturiser are a must, and try to brighten my eyes to make me look more awake :) I tend to stay away from full coverage foundation as winter arrives my skin become dry and foundation adds to the dryness. I also moisture like crazy and Chapstick is a MUST. Morning & Night <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D> and HIGHLIGHTING UNDER EYE CONCEALER especially when you get sick. nothing like a bit of brightness to your eyes. As for colour. I'm not one for the dark colours, but I steer away from the bright colours. I like to go more neutral with a soft lip colour to compliment my look. :) I use moisturizer even more and go from a powder foundation to a liquid and go for a mire natural look in colours and getva spray tan Lots of hydration to keep your complexion smooth and supple. Dark, smokey eyes with a warm latte lip or for an evening look, a light smokey eye with a rich coloured lip such as a deep red or violet! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008F> I use a thicker moisturiser, make sure not to indulge too much in comfort food and keep exercising!! I add a concealer cause I get spots in winter :( A thicker moisturiser, a more moisturising foundation in a lighter shade, and darker lip colours. Moisturise!!! Lighter coverage like bb creams :) use a richer moisturiser morning and night, LOTS of lip balm throughout the day and lip scrubs!  Amp up the bronzer to keep that glow going year round Darker lips, more intense moisturiser and lighter eye shadow = purity Dark lips and nails! Moisturiser and matte finishing products!

Moisturise and lip balm! The most simple yet useful changes! Oh and lighter foundation ;) Darker lipstick I don't know... HELP ME Australis Cosmetics! Please :) Heaps of moisturizer & dark nails! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> I don't do much different :) usually just a lighter shade of foundation :) I use more moisturiser as the cold seems to be harder on my skin. More moisturiser! Lighter foundation and keep the eyes natural as pos. And lip gloss! I try to keep it all the same, maybe a lighter nail polish as oppose to the rest, brighten them darker days! Retire the brights and bring out the darker colours, up the moisturiser and lip gloss to protect. I welcome each season with a change ! Winter is my favourite@ A matte foundation and dark lip are always good for Winter! You can't go wrong! Moisturise and bronzer smokey and darker colours for lips and eyes. deeper blush and moisturiser to prevent a flaky face. burgundy, mulberry and fushia lips go well too. leave in conditioner to stop fly aways, static hair and keep everything shiny and smooth. a good lip balm and lip stick to keep my lips moisturised and prevent cracked/chapped lips. coconut oil for dryness Cathy Nashar i will beat you anyday Adding more moisturising steps.

I think that's about it. As the weather gets colder I tend to use more moisturiser, lip balm and try drinking more water. My foundation gets lighter and l use darker lipstick colours. I use lipstick instead of gloss for a pop of colour and lighter eye shadow and darker nail colour :) I add rosehip oil to my moisturizer I definitely add dark lipsticks and thicker eyeliner. It's so gorgeous and totally easy to wear. I amp up my skincare routine to include more hydrating products and I use fuller coverage foundations for a flawless winter base. This foundation stick would make my winter routine quick and easy! A flawless base is key for when I wear darker colours on my lips! :) I start to use more earthy tones of make up in winter. And I always use a good moiturizer to combat dry skin from being in heated rooms. Lovely wintry colours like deep purple and chocolate brown, and a heavier duty moisturiser for the drying air :) I just use a lot more moisturizer as my skin tends to get a lot dryer in winter, I keep most of my colours the same :) Warmer colours hehe More moisturizer to combat cold winds, peppermint and citrus scented shower products to alive and waken senses on cold chilly mornings.. ..bright Red lips to lift my mood, trendy boots gloves and scarves to keep toasty and on trend, warm woody perfume to feel cozy and autumn coppery/golden eyeshadow shades to brighten the eyes and go with the colours of winter. :-) Several applications of moisturiser to keep up with winter dryness!

Make sure I put alot if moisturiser on seeing I seem to get dryer skin in winter!! Also a good lip gloss so I don't get cracked lips Go with a dark lippy <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> I use more moisturiser as my skin is more dry and use a more moisturising lipbalm. Also use more rich colours on my lips and eyes. And bit more bronzer as i loose my summer tan use a hydrating moisturiser lots of highlighting in winter Use a lighter foundation and pretend like it's summer with a good bronzer, to give you the sun kissed look. moisturise twice a day and pack on the lip balm ! Get new foundation/concealer/powder, change my colors to darker more warmer colors xx I add in moisturizer and use light coverage products xx I use a primer more often before my foundation to help hydrate and give more life to my dull skin, in winter my skin tends to get alot more dry patches! and to lift my winter blues i always add a pop of colour to my lips :) Can wear my hair out, cause no more frizzy, I can use a heavier moisturiser, as face isn't as greasy, so all in all winter likes me.

Other then that, I stick to my usual! moisturising is the key, wear light and pastel colours and definetyly water proof mascaara More moisturiser and lip balm to fight the skin winter ALWAYS gives me :( I use slightly lighter foundation and I love wearing dark lip pies like red,purple and brown. Dark lipstick is my fave part of winter! I use a body oil at night after my shower instead of a body lotion. In the mornings I still use my Nivea in shower conditioner which I started buying after trying a sample given to me at Priceline I amp up the night cream and day creams, and tend to do lighter eye makeup while using a lot more lip colors (love the velourlips) and lipbalms More moisturizing! My skin gets so dry during winter Winter's the perfect time to bring out the dark lipsticks and moisturising primers. I add luminiser to my foundation which I change from stick to liquid for a nice bright shimmer, bronzer for a healthy glow. Thicker night moisturiser to hydrate and some Argan & Coconut oil as a serum. I also run a little coconut oil through the ends of my hair to reduce frizz and nourish more high dryating moisturiser, more lip blam, and a more subtle smokey eye, and a cute little cat eye :) DianaMaria Manu Juneja  I make myself drink more water! More moisturising, illuminating products and dark lipsticks! In winter I tend to wear less makeup on a daily basis, just a CC cream & powder to set & always a lippy for moisture & I increase the amount of water I drink ! Environmental skin serum extra boost to create barrier from  winter weather conditions. moisturise twice a day and drink plenty of water I wear my Australis blackest black eyeliner pencil and mascara along with my australis foundation and powder. Bit of blush to add some warmth to my cheeks and a white eyeshadow to contrast the dark eyeliner and mascara. Finish off with a dark red lippy!

Use moisturiser more :) switch to foundation instead of bb cream and dark lips! <3 I pull out the bronzer to add warmth to my face and darker lipsticks to keep my look edgy and on trend ;) Wearing darker colours on my lips and adding moisturiser to my mineral powder to help fight the dry skin :) thicker eyeliner, dark lips and full coverage foundation Mousturise more and use a thicker primer for dry skin. use a good quality moisturiser loads more moisturiser and a bit more eyeliner and mascara Moisturise, more water and more lip gloss <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> Moisturise, more water and more lip gloss <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> Lots of moisturizer and lip balm! I use a slightly darker eye shadow and slightly darker lips. Before I go to bed I put pawpaw cream (LOVE that stuff) on any dry skin on my face so it's soft and smooth again by morning. I always carry a moisturising lip balm with me and apply before facing the cold wind! (Untinted Lip balm is also great for any unexpected dry spots that pop up during the day that I don't want to put greasy pawpaw on!) Lots of moisturizing in winter! And the opportunity to use winter accepted colours such as coppers & blacks and dark lippy's!!!! One word: moisturise i start by using a warm face mask to rehydrate my skin and oprn my pores and use a cucumber moisturizer and and australis foundation  Go for dark lips instead of bright summer colours, less contouring and embracing the natural pale skin look while going for a more intense eye look, and you cant forget the brown eyeliner and full black lashes :) Cleanse & exfoliate the face then moisturise! :D More moisturiser, a lot thicker too and also lots more lip bam,m and always carry a spare in the car I use more hydrating products on my skin & I like to wear a dark, vampy lip :) I always go more deeper, darker and more mysterious for winter. My new routine started last week with some new Australis eyeshadow to compliment my pale features, gotta love winter and Australis! Darken my brown smokey eye to blacks and keep up a strong moisturising routine. And strong dark lips my fav grunge colour inject! In summer i go for simple eyes and bright lips, with flip flops and oversized tops. In winter i go for the sultry dark eyes or a nice featured eyeliner with plum or dark coloured lip with knits  (my fav off the shoulder knit jumper) and sneaker wedges and of course the beanie. lip gloss <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+008B><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> Add more hydrating products and more exfoliation so my skin doesn't get dull or dry.

I change how often I exfoliate as winter time makes my skin so dry! And just like in summer, I apply moisturiser morning and night with an spf15. I also limit how much powder I use and try to opt for cream blushes. I tend to lean towards softer eye shadows and soft pink lip sticks or gloss also A rich, illuminating primer to stop my skin drying out and my makeup looking flakey. For lipsticks I go for paler colours like nudes and muted pinks, and deep plums and reds. I love a smokey eye with golds or silvers to brighten up my look a bit or keep it simple with winged liner. I stop using fake tan but still use a touch of bronzer to contour to warm up my face a bit. More colour to brighten up my day during the drearier months :) Im tend to wear more dark moody colours and cool tones in winter and get as much moisture as possible into my skin :) I always moisturize  my skin and lip cos it get dry in winter and drink alot of water :) Love this makeup and the way it makes me feel! :) moisterise more and wear less makeup and a dark lippy I dont change it because i dont have amazing Australis products to help me   :3 In Winter I opt for a more moisturising full coverage foundation and I tend to wear cooler shadows on the eyes <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> also I use winter as an excuse to rock deep red and plum lipsticks more mosturiser x100, and warmer colours for eyes and lips! Brown smokey eye tones instead if brighter colours and warmer blushes instead of bronzer :) and obviously a lighter colour of australis pressed powder as I dont 't fake tan in winter :) shared, i change everything about my skin care in winter, more frequent exfoliations and masks to hydrate, active ingredient night moisturiser, eye and lip cream, i even change from mineral power foundation to liquid in the cooler months I use more moisturisers and keep lip gloos on me constantly, but when I go out I tend to use more blue eye shadows for winter and more pinks and oranges for summer :) A ritual of moisturising and face masks does me just fine! And drinking plenty of water helps too! Haha in winter I do my make up with a hand held mirror in the lounge by the heater! That's the main change to my beauty routine ;) Lots of moisturiser and lip balm :) In summer i will lean towards bb creams and foundations that don't feel too heavy on the skin because i will feel like my makeup is melting off. 
I use alot of cream eyeshadows and blushes as they stay put and if i go in the water there most likely to not wash away aswell as waterproof mascara. For lips i love to have bright pink and coral lips and for cheeks 
When going out i will use coral and pink lipsticks to brighten and complete my summer look aswell as a light bronzer.

For winter i love full coverage foundations, and using illuminators and illuminating primers to give me a flawless dewey and glowing look. Dark purple / red lips with a neutral matte / satin eyeshadows and a bold black eyeliner on the top lash with heaps of mascara and false lashes <3 I change my make-up colours, I wear moisture, many years ago I use to use the Australis  skincare range plus shampoo and conditioner, I use smokier shades on my eyes and I moisturise 10 times more and lip balm
I don't normally use blush but in winter I do because it gives a bit more colour in the face <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> I use a night oil to keep my skin smooth. As well as the Australia primer to make a perfect base for my foundation. I use a lip scrub to get the flakey dry skin away. Then a moisturising lip balm. I use cooler tones on the eyes. A waterproof mascara in case I'm stuck in the rain (you never know) More plums, purples and deep wine reds for me! I moisturise the everloving heck out of my skin, more face masks, more hair treatments. Darker lippys. I add a lip moisturiser to my daily routine as I get dry lips in winter. Defiantly my skin is a lot more drier , I like to update my routine with serums for hydrating and moisturizing my skin and face masks and lots of lip balms, and with my makeup I love a plums and deep colors for my lips with basic natural eyes , I expec love your lipstick grunge , my fav winter lipstick :) Swap the gloss for lipstick! I switch to using a more moisturising and richer formulation of day creme and at night time I rely on my trusty rosehip oil. In winter I love to change things up and wear more liner and a smokey eye and love to add a red or pink lipstick I go for darker colors in Winter also I use plenty of moisturiser as the heater messes with my skin! <3 Change light gloss too darker lipstick with reds and oranges and dark maroons. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0081> Lippy changes from pink to red! My makeup transition from summer to winter is awesome! I can finally rock all the dark plum lips, hot smokey eyes and wear my hair down! I love the winter beauty routine! Gone are the days of melting foundation and messy buns! These are the months I can enjoy my makeup staying on my skin because its not sweated off and gone are my 'bad hair' days! I always lather my skin in moisturizers and keep my lips fresh and plump with a lip balm! I love matte foundation in winter paired with a bold set of lips or eyes!

fit in with the cold times ahead! I put more lip balm and moisturiser on and use more earthy tones and shades on my lips and eyes and I add a light blush to give my face some colour and not too much mascara on the rainy days :) In winter I change nothing except my attitude to winter :O) In winter I tend to use more mouistiser coz  my skin drys out i use more balm for underneath my lipstick A good lip balm is my go-to in winter ALWAYS. Also moisturizing is a must. Love winter make up!! Not needing to worry about it melting off or smudging as much! Can finally use those darker warmer colours to bring out your features and go that little bit heavier so no one notices your red nose and blue lips. Love winter beauty!! Neutral eyes and a bold red lip I lean on and carry with me my trusty Australis Mineral Highlights to keep my summer glow going in winter! ADDED BONUS...it contains Vitamin E which provides extra moisture, every little bit counts!! ;) I must admit I wear more make up in Winter..Summer gives that fab glow from sun and sea and warmth! Winter seems to take it away, so I always go for red lippy, a really good moisturiser and blusher. Lots and lots of lip balm, and I love dark lips for winter :') I change my bb cream to the flawless foundation and use lots more moisturizer to stop my skin from drying out. Use bronzes and earthy shadows and then I can rock the darker lip colours too! By using more moisturising products to protect my skin during winter and sticking to a brown/ purple eyeshadow with a dark red lip. Heavier foundation and dark lips is what its all about for me in winter! Just becuase its miserable outside doesnt mean I can't look amazing! lots more lip balm haha I usually put lip balm on more often along side with  my moisturiser. I also use a shade lighter of foundation as my skin gets paler. Moisturiser when feeling dry from heaters ,lip balm ,cold winds I embrace my lack of tan with some awesome dark lipsticks. Also try to keep my lips moisturised :-D Darker, smokey eyes, lots of moisturiser! :-) <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> A lovely moisturiser to suit dryer skin. A lot if lip balm. And warm colours like browns :) Moisturiser & lip balm, lots of them As soon as it gets colder I use oils such as (bio oil) and heavy moisturizers under my makeup to keep my skin nice and plump all day. I also make sure I carry a hand and nail cream in my bag to keep my cuticles nice and healthy to prevent any breakages or hang nails! I can't stand dry lips so I use a sugar scrub at night, and pawpaw ointment before bed. I usually stick with smokey eyes because I can change up the colours to suit my mood. I usually use my Naked 2 palette and stick with the browns. Winter is my favourite time of the year, I just have to be extra organized when it comes to my beauty regime! i use a serum then a moisturizer before my foundation :) I change it up by using darker lippies :) I  use more mouistiser :) and use a good lip balm even at night :) Hydrated lips is a must! I invest in a good lip balm, lighten my foundation and experiment with lots of fun darker shades of eyeshadow/ lippy :) Dewy moisturising primer, lip balm and darker lipstick colours and natural shades on my eyes More moisturised and a lip scrub to ensure al the dead skin is gone No primer in winter and matte foundation rather than dewy I tend to moisturize a lot more and then use a glowy highlighter under my foundation so that my skin looks brighter and go for a deep purple berry lip and cream blushes instead off powder :) During the colder months I opt for a more moisturising foundation to fight the dryness that comes with winter. I try to avoid matte foundations because they can stick to the dry patches of skin. On the cheeks, a little rosy blush would add a but of colour back to the face for a flushed look. Nothing says winter like soft smoky eyes and dark sultry lips. I especially love dark purple and berry hues for a vampy look (my fave is australis colour inject lipstick in grunge), but before I put on my lipstick, I apply a lip balm to keep my lips protected as well. lighter shade in foundation and lighter bronzer/contour A nice moisturiser to suit dryer skin. lip balm. And warm colours like browns I get  really dry skin, so I use moisturiser religiously especially under my foundation :) I also love using vampy colours all over ...eyes, lips, nails...you name it!! Changing colours and finishes is something I change between seasons - summer is for those bright popping colours and the dewey skin with lots of gorgeous bronzer to reflect the summer sun.
Winter on the other hand is very sultry with a simple matte base, minimal flush on the cheeks and a deep lip colour for me. I'll
Also note that as winter sucks the moisture out of you, moisturizing primers and a lip balm can lock the moisture in and keep your skin looking fresher. During winter I don't wear any makeup at all unless going out etc., but the change I make is that I keep my lips hydrated wit some lip balm. I also moisturise more, almost everyday. Its all about moisturising. Who wants flaky skin when there's real snowflakes outside? I go for dark lips and nails with plums and purples,  change my foundation to match my paler winter skin and make sure I use moisturising products to avoid my skin drying out excessively! :) Highlighting and warm blush tones so my face doesn't look so washed out! Lots of darker lip colours! And I prefer more of a matte makeup look in the winter with winged liner :) When I'm doing my beauty routine in winter I use my hair dryer as a heater lol and face it on me on the sink while doing my makeup <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0084> also winter for me is more about eyes and especially cheeks! to your face some colour!  <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0084> I've been using a lighter foundation because my face for some reason gets lighter in winter hahaha but I pear it with dark vampy lips , I love this look I wear it everyday <U+263A><U+FE0F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095> Out with the nude lipsticks and in with red and purples :) I always shake up my collection with a brand new hydrating foundation usually a shade lighter than my last. In winter I pull out my lip balms or even better, my paw paw ointment as it works for everything- lip primer, moisturizer, lip balm, you name it! Also applying more colour to your face and going for the deeper lip colors :) thicker mascara? oh and also applying sunscreen can help moisturizer and protect from the sun( even when you think it's not sunny!) I have a more hydrating regime. And I do more exfoliating. My foundation shade gets lighter, and my blush and lip colours go deeper and bolder. My skin gets so dry! I use anything to help with dryness and to protect myself against the awful weather, and I also wear darker lip colours and a lot of lipbalm! I love to use more full coverage foundations and a lot of bronzer to keep the paleness away! :P Warm baths, loads of moisturizer, face serums,  dark lippies and a rosy blush! If I win then that would be how I would change for winter Adding lots of warm reds and purples to my lips. Lifts my whole outfit! But you can't forget to have bold eyelashes. You need that mega lash! See what I did there :) Use the australis dewy setting spray-helps keep skin hydrated and makeup lasts longer :) Blush instead of bronzer, a lighter shade of foundation, and red lippy instead of a pink <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098> I wear my Australis bronzer so I don't look so pasty - it's my winter holy grail product!! Lot's of warm dark red lipstick! Lighter foundation and a bit more eye shadow and liner :-) I like to rock a soft smoky eye with a deep lipstick. Warm, sultry plums, reds and deep emeralds to banish the cold. I also make sure to up the hydration with extra balm for my lips, and a deep, rich nail polish to pretty up my fingertips! I use more moisturizer and lip balm ! I also exfoliate more often and moisturizing face masks are a must ! And as for makeup, I change my foundation shade to a lighter one and I use more bronzer and more of a plum blush just to warm up the cheeks and add a little blush as cheeks will naturally flush ! Nail polish colours also become darker to more of deep reds and deep plums :) and body butter is also ideal !! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0081><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0081> Definitely change to a lighter foundation,  I generally wear less make up because winter makes me lazy. I wear bronzer more often to add colour to my pale face and to contour it. I tend to go with a more natural look in winter :) I always use a lip scrub like Lush lip Bubblegum lip scrub to keep my lips smooth as they get quite dry during the winter! I lighten my hair and ditch foundation for tinted moisturizer Sensitive skin moisturiser for more hydration and liquid foundation instead of powder ones because winter tends to give me dry skin! And peach coloured cheek :) I use bolder and brighter colours on my lips, eyes and cheeks because I tend to dress in neutral colours in winter - I need the contrast! Lots of moisturizer and lip balm, heavier concealer as my broken capillaries and dark circles seem angrier in winter and smudged pencil eyeliner cos I don't have to worry about it smearing and sweating off! My main change to my winter routine is that I add more bronzers and blusher to my foundation routine because I'm always looking so pale! I also have to do my makeup with my cat snuggling up to me because it's so cold and I end up getting cat hair all over my outfit ready to go out! :) :) Lots of lip balm, my lips are always so dry especially in winter! Warm bronzer and blush to live me a bit more colour, especially since I often get sick this time of year and no one likes looking all washed out and sick! Definitely more moisturiser & lip balm & bright reds on lips :) The only thing I change is using a heavy eye moisturiser as my eyes get super dry in winter I changed to a creamy cleanser and a rich moisturiser to keep my skin moisturised. Deep blush tones and darker lips x I like to tone down the bright colours like pink lipstick! x I really don't do anything so would love to win this and then I could. Lots of moisturiser and sooting creams :) I change my lipsticks to a deeper colour and apply eyeliner on my waterline. My blush is a deeper colour too I love wearing cool-toned colours in winter because they look nice with my fair winter complexion! I mix my summer foundation shade with a fairer shade, customising each time, until eventually I don't need the darker shade at all! Looking forward to winter makeup shenanigans! ;) Thanks Australis Cosmetics! Tinted moisturiser and mint condition lip gloss Use more moisturizing and hydrating products (i.e. hydrating foundations)! Cold weather always makes my skin feel very dry and tight, to combat this I make sure I use my Rosehip oil day and night. I layer on my serum, Rosehip oil and moisturiser to ensure my skin is protected and adequately hydrated. I wear a shade lighter foundation, Love Australis Cosmetics Bright lip colours or dramatic eyeshadow :) I mix up my beauty routine for winter by toning down the colour while experimenting with textures and finishes. cleanse moisturise on with the makeup I get out my pastiest shade of foundation and my brightest shade of illuminiser! Lip balm, lip balm and more lip balm. Need I say more? :) I whip out my heavy duty moisturizers, keep the skin fresh and natural (finishing my skin with the Ready Set Go powder), go a rosy matte colour on the cheeks, and embrace more sultry colours on my eyes and lips!

I'm absolutely loving Australis Go Long lipstick in Ghetto on this chilly days. I've been pairing my Australis Matte Me with my Colour Inject lipsticks as well. I love playing with texture during the colder months. Moisture is the key! I change from powders to mostly liquid products and I up the anti on my lip balm! I change my beauty routine for winter by moisturising and using lip balms a lot more! Dark lip colours are also a must!

Tilleigh <U+1EE4>ltra enter dis <3 I use a shade lighter in my Australis powder and use richer colours to match my darker wardrobe. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098> Moisturising is the key for winter! I would also add more radiant and glowing blush so I don't look so pail and add a creamy lipgloss or lipstick!! :):) Lots of moisturizer, I love my foundation to b a little bit thicker in the winter as I have very dry skin.. thats the only thing that really changes as the rest depends on what mood im in and my style :) In winter I really like a bit of drama. Darker eyeshadows and a nice bold lip, I love it. 
Specially teaming the bold make up with nice heavy coats or scarves. 
I adore winter makeup colours. i boost my beauty regime with brighter lipsticks and more lip balm as well as more moisturiser....gorgoeus  bright red or pink lips can cheer up any dull, wintry day! Using a thicker moisturiser and primer :) When my skin is super dry, I moisturise with coconut oil ;) For winter I use more moistoriser to avoid dry skin and more subtle light colours on the eyes instead of bold dark colours but with a bold lipstick like dark purple I switch up my moisturising routine to more frequently and use my banana and oatmeal face mask more often tastes great to :D I have to go defensive over winter. Sure, I have oily skin, but the wind still rips me to shreds. 
To combat this, I actually only wash my face at night, followed by a balancing serum and a nourishing moisturiser. Makeup wise, I'll wear darker eye colours and less blush, as the wind raises the colour in my cheeks naturally. I keep lips pretty natural to hide the wind damage. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> I do my make up in front of a heater hahaha and wear deep coloured lipsticks <3 LOVE deep purples at the moment! I've changed to a more moisturising foundation & also warmer toned eyeshadows. Thicker moisturiser and primer, looking desperately  for a paler foundation for my vampire skin. And busting out the burgundy Eyeshadows and berry lipsticks! Awww yeah. I swap powder foundation in summer to liquid foundation in winter...it's all about moisturising and a bright lip colour to brighten my not-so tanned winter face <U+263A><U+FE0F> Changed to using Lancome's neocalm moisturizer so my skin can combat the cold and still look good while wearing makeup ^^ no flaky skin for me! Lots of moisturizer + lip balm as well as a good primer,  fuller coverage foundation due to more redness in my skin in colder weather and use of warmer tones :) Moisturising with a think creme at night after you take your makeup off and using plenty of primer before applying your makeup makes it's easier to apply and gives a more even and flawless look <U+2764><U+FE0F> also because winter is a wee bit dull I like to add a bright pop of colour like bright orange, pink, burgundy, emerald, or blue lippy<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084>makes people look twice and gives you glowing confidence <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098><U+270C><U+FE0F>xoxox More moisturiser for sure!!! & white eyeliner to look more awake lol For winter I incorporate coconut oil for a stronger moisturising treatment before bed to rid my skin of horrible winter dryness! My skin is drier in Winter so I use either more moisterizer after cleansing or something with a slightly more oily feel to it. When doing my makeup I used a primer that feels more like a light grease than the ones that feel like moisterizer.  I use a lighter foundation, with heaps of a pressed powder above my liquid foundation and concealers. I ALWAYS use a finishing powder to make sure it stays matte. I stick to brown or light pink/purple shades for eyeshadow and a solid black eyeliner. I NEVER forget to tightline my upper lash line and I love volumizing mascara to add emphasis to my already long lashes.  I stick to pinks and reds for my lips or a nude/brown. I wear a lighter eye shadow for summer and brighter lipsticks and for winter wear a fuller coverage foundation Moisturizer is an essential for winter even though I have oily skin, and if I am wanting to wear a lip colour the dark berry reds and purples create the best look for winter.

thanks Teshy <3 I change my beauty routine by wear stuff to make me stand out more like dark eye shadow. And wear red bright lip stick  I change my beauty and makeup routine by being able to wear a full face of makeup without worrying that it will end up sweating off or melting slightly making me look a bit feral. :) Try to avoid hot showers (although cold mornings don't help) as it dries  out your skin,  pawpaw ointment and drink plenty of water and green tea) :) tons of mosturiser!! Using Australis' cream blush instead of powder blush! Keeps your skin moisturised with a pretty flush of colour. The Australis creme colour can also be used for your lips :) I tend to use more moisturiser, make my eyebrows darker and wear a darker lip. I also tend to wear winged liner every day rather than just when I'm going out. I use more moisturiser to help with dry skin, I use warmer colours on my eyes and deeper tones on my lips Multiple cups of green tea! Run every day, moisturise! PRIME Of course! 
Eat lots of spinach, nuts, beetroot,  kale and capsicum to keep the nutrients up!
A bottle of water a day :)
And a shot of spiralina before bed!
Makeup is a must! But so is removing it before bed!! <3 i change my beauty routine for winter by switching to a milky cleanser n a heavy moisturiset n choose dark colours for my lips n swap bb creams for foundations  In winter I give my skin a breather and try to go as natural as possible.some days just a simple BB cream and a little mascara.But plenty of moisturizer to keep my skin soft I change up my makeup routine in winter by wearing a tinted moisturiser and wearing natural tone eye shadows like browns and greens the y make me feel warm. Dark lips, simple eyes:) As tempted as I am I dont bump the temperature of the shower water up as water that is too hot just dries out my skin. During Summer my feet overheat but in Winter its the perfect time to lather my feet with moisturiser just before bedtime and pop some socks on  and by morning my feet will be baby soft.
Lots of moisture for my face.  Bolder colours in makeup.  The weather might be dull but there is no need to join it....stay vibrant. Eyes get smokier, lip colour gets richer, highlighter gets a good workout for extra glow! I moisturise daily in winter I focus more on perfecting my foundation and concealer and also wearing darker lipsticks to change up my winter routine <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008A> I use a thicker moisturiser, longer lasting foundations and Australis Cosmetics eye make up, for a darker smokier look More serum for more hydration. Summer/winter
Powder/liquid
Nude eyeshadow/colour (weird I know)
Tinted lip balm/lip stick I usually do a different skin routine in winter. I use a moisturizer twice a day and a lighter foundation!
:) By using more moisturising lip balm during winter I of course have a lighter foundation, I use a lot brighter lipsticks and spent overall longer time on my makeup because it's not like I'm going to go to the beach and wash it off :) using less and lighter foundation, go for more of a bold eye and lips in winter! always something on the lips! Thicker moisturising cream In winter I want a flawless coverage ,I fill my brows , contour more , use warmer colours on my eyes and apply dark brown mascara without lining my eyes. A bold red, maroon, plum , baby pink or nude lipstick will always pull the look together :) I focus more on my skin and try to be creative with darker colours! Whether it's on my eyes, lips or cheeks I love experimenting with new colours! i change my beauty and makeup routine by wearing light pink lipstick and scrubbing my face at least twice a week Darker lips, neutral eyes and a moisturizing base! I lather my skin with thicker moisturiser to combat the dry air and my heater! Use moisturiser everyday after a warm shower, frequent use of hand cream to make my hands smooth and vaseline to ensure there are no chapped lips! Lots of Moisturizer as my skin gets dryer in winter and warm and bold colored makeup to match my cosy winter feeling.. :) Jill Allen :) I actually use less makeup. But more lipstick. Brighten my face up I Don't really change much tbh. Jus more colours! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008B> Defenatly lots of moisturiser I moisturise more so i swap foundation for a tinted moisturiser, i use only mascara and no eye shadow and deeper lip colours to make myself feel a bit warmer. More moisturiser, primer and warmer tones I like to add in bight lippie and bring back a subtle bronzed glow with blusher and or bronzer not much makeup, just a bit of eyeliner/mascara, maybe some bb cream to moisturise my face <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0099><U+2764><U+FE0F> I find that in winter I need to moisturise more. I also exfoliate more often to remove dry wind blown skin. I wear darker lipsticks, more moisturiser and change to my lighter, winter foundation. Moisturiser, moisturiser, moisturiser. I also change my foundation :-) More moisturizer and more dewy makeup looks! Eyeliner mascara an moisturise daily <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D> Less bronzer lol I add an layer of moisturiser under my bb cream and go for more plum toned lip colours :) Moisturise the face. Moisturise the body. Winter is such a drying time for skin More moisturiser and lip balm! And less lipstick because my lips tend to get very, very dry. I add a little more colour to my face so that it brightens up the look. I like to apply extra blush and perhaps a bright lippy. A good moisturizer is also handy as it keeps skins hydrated and not dry during the winter seasons :) exfoliate my lips every day - lips get so dry and chapped during winter! smooth lips make lipstick perfect Winter is all about skin luminosity rather than the tanned summer glow. I add a pearlised illuminator to my foundation, and swap the bronzer for the rose blushes! More moisturiser! I love the porcelain skin and intense lip/eye look. so a pale foundation and either a smokey eye or a deep red or purple lipstick, plus a bit of blush to add some colour back into my cheeks By making sure not to skip the primer and using a more moisturising foundation its best to change from a powdered foundation to a liquid one for a more dewy look and to also help moisterise the skin  also by switching from a powder blush to a cream one as its better for the dry skin that comes with winter and also use cream eye shadows too instead of powdered and to top off your makeup look swap your lip stain for a more hydrating formula as it helps with the dry chapped lips that comes with winter and voila a more hydrated look for your winter dry skin. I wear quite dark colours through winter, so I like to brighten my look with a pink lipstick, and always add that bit extra moisturiser than I normally would to keep my face looking lush :) I change my lip colour up from reds to more plum shades & I wear full coverage foundation as I break out more in winter. Drink even more water and use even more moisturiser. And never, never leave home without lip balm! I always use the Australis primer in winter to ensure my makeup goes on extra smooth in the dryer months. As much as itï¿½s tempting to stand under a long, hot shower when itï¿½s cold outside, resist the urge. The hot water will begin to compromise your skinï¿½s lipid layer that holds in precious moisture. Turn down the heat or shorten your shower time, and moisturise straight after the shower while your skin is still damp, using a cream that creates a barrier to stop moisture from evaporating. Also apply a creamy-based mask once a week as a moisture booster. For winter I do my usual skin cleansing routine (cleanse, exfoliate, tone & moisturise) except I exfoliate 3 days a week instead of 2 because in winter blood circulation slows down which results in slowing down of skin regeneration (renewal). In a winter skin care routine I make sure I never forget to use an eye cream for puffiness and dark circles and a balm for my lips. I also make sure that once EVERY week, I use a skin mask to tighten my skin and close my pores to ensure that all the good active ingredients from the products I've used stay in my skin for better results. And last but not least, I change my moisturiser from a light weight one for combination to oily skin to a thicker one for dry to combination skin. 

For my make up, I ALWAYS make sure I put a sunscreen on before anything else because the harmful rays of the sun can come through the clouds and cause damage to your skin, even in Winter! Other than that I like to opt more for light pinks and silvers for my eyes instead of greys, browns and black
.... Light rosey pink blush instead of bronze and I always wear hot pink or red lipstick no matter what the season is. To me, it doesn't really matter about what make up I wear each season cause I just experiment with my make up all the time anyways. Winter woes to winter wow! Shades of winter becomes a wonderland with a burst of colour on my lips, popping peeps (eyes) by long flash lashes - waterproof mascara comes out to play with prime(r) time, sunblock foundation fit to stay. Night time fun provides winged dark eyeliner to extra define, whilst nails get a slick of neutral or warmth to keep me feeling fine. Australis to have me primped from head to toe so winter can warm by my radiant glow :) Darker, earthier coloured eyes over winter and foundation gets a little lighter (: My foundation is lighter and my lipstick and nail colour are a bit darker. Exfoliation. Exfoliation. Exfoliation. Deep moisturization. Darker eye makeup and nude lip. Lots of Lucas Papaw Ointment at night on lips, face, hands & elbows. I switch from a powder to liquid foundation and wear a lot more lipstick! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098> I'm not a winter girl, I love the sun, heat and beach... So in the winter I wear Brighter blush! To bring a bit of summer to my face!! Exfoliate more, extra night moisturiser, matte makeup and more subtle eyes and brighter lips to bring some colour on cold mornings Darker lip colours, smokey eyes and lighter foundation :) x Lip balm! I moisturise daily and use a daily cleanser and face scrub. I've also started putting on a collagen face mask Moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! I am packing on the hydrating serums and moisturiser and still wearing my SPF I change my foundation to a lighter colour because i go white as a ghost in winter! & def dark red lips <3 my makeup gets a bit more dramatic if we go out in the evenings, richer lips and smokier eyes :-) - must keep up the moisturizer too :-) Add some colour to my pale winter skin to brighten up each day I use more moisturiser and a little more colour than in the summer More moisturizer to keep my face hydrated, a light coat of bronzer over the top of my foundation to give my face some warmth and warm tones of lipstick <U+2764><U+FE0F> Darker eyes, d"

Deeper shadow and lips, more hydrating foundation! Darker, bold lipstick!! Contour more!! But sometimes I do bright lips just to brighten up those dull days!! Dark plum hues <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+009A> Other than a lighter shade of foundation - I don't! Maybe I should though (and maybe some new makeup might help with this ;) ) A fuller coverage face. I love the elegant look with winter fashion. Cat liner and deep lipsticks are my go to! As it gets colder I always need more moisturiser and more BB cream under my foundation.. as my face is always so dry in the cold wind. Also putting away the red/pink blush and bringing out the bronzer to look more sunkissed on thr gloomy winter days Matte and lighter foundation and darker lips no gloss or bronzer Using lots of moisturising lip balm to keep away chapped lips and deeper lipstick shades to brighten the face as the summer glow starts to fade away Deeper coloured eye shadows matched with deep lipstick! With dark eyeliner <U+2764><U+FE0F> I go for matte finish with products in winter with darker shaddows and a bolder lip moituriser, and darker deeper colours Lighter foundation with dark lippy n love heavy eye liner too <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> Darker everything and nude lips Instead of using BB cream I use foundation and I apply both eyeliner and mascara whereas in the summer it's either one or the other. Other than that I don't change much else apart from using face masks more often! A more moisturising foundation and dark lips :) Darker eyes, soft nude lips and a warm blush! Nude eyes with only mascara, defined cheeks and a dark plum lip ;) Darker lips and lighter foundation for the winter with darker shades if eye showdown and moisturiser and lip balm I would change my winter routine by using darker warm tones. Nice bright red lips Brown's and plums for eyeshadows with lighter foundation and purple pinkish blushes. Moisturizer that stop the skin from drying out <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> I'm in love with dark lipstick (Grunge is my fave!!) and dark nails, so winter is when I do my happy dance because I can wear it without looking out of season!!! I do break out bright colours though to perk up the dreary cold days of winter :D Dewy foundation smokey eyes and nude glossy lips! Plum lippy at night for that lush look matching up with neutral chunky knits and faux fur xx More natural warm colours and def more cream everywhere imaginable I use a lighter coloured blush for that pop of colour, but one thing that doesn't change is the use of my fresh and flawless powder ! <3 I use a cooler blush for a natural glow of lighter skin! Lots of extra moisturizing! Im a busy Mum so a lighter foundation or BB cream makes it easier. Swap my lip gloss for lip  balm <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> Depends on what fun new products I find each year! Lighter foundation and contour, dark berry and burgundy lips, a well defined brow and almost too much mascara I add more sparkle, whether eye-shadow, eyeliner. So when the sun does come out, I can shine with it, against such dreary weather. I use more warmer undertone blushers and redder toned lips and natural warm toned eyeshadows , defined brows and lots of mascara :) xxx Dark lips and lots of moisturising products
And of course my holy grail fresh and flawless powder ;) For my skin I change over to more emollient and moisturising products,  for makeup more neutral and earthy tones like rich browns and plummy shades. Foundation with primer, soft pinks and nude eyes Moisturising products to combat dryness I change up my beauty routine for winter by exfoliating regularly, moisturizing and incorporating lots of golds and coppers into my eye makeup. Warmer colours are a must for winter :) But of course have a couple of products that are lighter for the days where it's still warm Change of foundation , bronzer to warm up from the lack of sun or spraytan , more moisture for the face , lip preparation exfoliating dry lips and balm <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+008B><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B9> I change from Mattes to dewy finish. It also means I can whip out my vampy lips and warm smokey eye for a day look. My all time fav. I will go for lighter coral lipstick with heavy accent on my eyes to give it a fuller eye look :) i moisturise a lot more in winter, i find the weather dries me out and lots of hydrating lip balm! Lighter foundation, more moisturiser, and extra lip balm to save my lips against the freezing winter wind!!!<U+2744><U+FE0F><U+26C4><U+FE0F> Lighter foundation & more earth coloured tones, but a colour pop in the lips Use more moisturising products like foundation, cream blush & hydrating lipstick I go down a shade in foundation during Winter. I exfoliate 3 x a week, and use night cream instead of my normal moisturiser, for an extra moisture boost. As a mum of a toddler I don't have time for an extensive make up routine, luckily fresh and flawless is the perfect coverage for me and doesn't dry out my skin anymore than winter already does, I go a shade down in winter as my natural tan fades! Mascara is a must and I always make sure I moisturise after exfoliating and wear lots of tinted lip balms for a bit of colour! Vampy deep colours and staying away from drying silicon primers, TONS of moisturiser, and a crap ton of lip balm i wear more pearlescent shadows & a dark berry lip Lighter foundation with more moisturizing. My skin seems to love winter! The only issue I play with is dry skin. I also play with lighter eyeshadows and darker creases with pinker cheeks! I use rose hip oil at night for more moisture in my skin and I change from a bronzer to a blush on my cheeks in winter. And oh brown warm eye shadow colors. I will be mostly using a lighter foundation with a darkish carmel and eyeshadow darker brown crease and a shimmery champane in the inner corner ro brighten it all up, also a more defigned cheak bone and a bit of bronser to give a bit of a glow that the winter makes me lose. And also heaps of red lipstick to make sure i still look a bit bright :)

Other than that red, black or maroone nail polish is the go for me :)

And primer heaps of primer, my makeup look is never complete without the stuff :) A stunning dark lip! First I wear a decent lather of my favourite lip balm then powder, line and apply my ox blood or deep aubergine colour ever so carefully! A fuller coverage foundation for my very pink nose from the cold haha, and a darker smokey eye By applying moisturiser underneath. My skin needs a little more hydration in the winter! Thicker moisturiser, matte foundation, thicker lashes, dark berry lips, blush and pearly eyeshadows Moisturise daily, cat flick eyeliner and warm red lippy! :) Look after your skin- mosterise-primer- & a flawless foundation coverage. Eat Right & Look right! x Lighter full coverage foundation, dark but bold lip colour and smokey eye shadow I like to wear blush, instead of a bronzer and use a lighter colours on my eyes with eyeliner. Lots of exfoliating. .. I usually opt for dewy skin but today I wore a really Matte finish foundation with coral coloured blush :) I got so many compliments!! I always like to add a darker bold lip. Also, lots of moisturiser and primer before applying foundation is a must-do! Simple makeup, with a bold lip colour, flawless foundation, mascara, and a touch of blush to the cheek to add some colour to the face <U+263A><U+FE0F> I use more coloured lip balms because my lips get so dry and a hydrating foundation or bb cream! I also love dark lips in winter, plums for sure. Lighter foundation, red blush, red lipstick and black mascara! I matt everything! i love winter because i can go dark with my lips like reds and purples, i also use heavier moisturiser to my skin doesnt try out pick mee!!! I double moisturise. Instead of using a five cent piece of moisturiser I use a ten cent piece size. Moisturise more, use warmer colours, bronzer, and lip balm lol <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+008B> moisturise more often i mostirise my face more often and exfoliate!!!:) btw yes please for the prize darker eyeshadow looks and a lot more lip balm <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+008B> By applying a hydrating moisturiser underneath foundation, defining the cheeks by contouring topped off with a bold yet elegant plum shade lipstick, you have created a look that me, myself and I would wear in winter! More moisturiser, thicker foundation to avoid the coldness from drying skin out and dramatic eyes #australis full coverage matte foundation, warmed toned eye shadows and darker lips loving dark red lips at the moment x I moisturise my face and neck more often and apply a lip balm frequently and wear a nice pink blush :) Moisturize to the max!! Dark lips, shimmery eyeshadows, thicker foundation and more defined blushes- all australis products of course! #australis By using more moisturising products and using darker colours ! More moisturiser & less blush. My cheeks go pink enough already in the cold! Haha ^_^

I also have a foundation one shade lighter for winter as my skin doesn't get as much sun :( Use warmer colours for face and darker shades of eyeshadow. Put on lip balm more often also so they can be moisturised and not dry out. I love darker blush and purpley plum lipstick for winter and I wear a lot more moisturiser than normal because my skin gets really dry I go all out 24/7 because I don't have to be scared of it all melting off :) Less eyeshadow but more eyeshadow with darker lips I use BB in winter and wear more neutral shades. get rid of the foundation and replace with moisturiser - just wear concealer with powder, to let the natural skin colour through; and longer, darker lashes! Darker eye makeup and a tinted lip balm =) dark lips and silver instead of just black cat eyeliner :) Moisturise and warmer colours, plus lighter foundation ;) and definitely mascara to highlight eyes :) I switch to a more moisturising foundation rather than a longer wearing one for summer! I also prefer the dewy look in winter. My skin gets so dry and itchy in winter! Extra nourishment is required! More moisturiser and a softer makeup look, nothing bold. Use products that are more moisturising and moisturise before hand with a heavier one rather than a lighter for summer! A semi matte lip colour and apply a little more mascara than normal as I don't wear much eyeshadow :) I go from light colours to warmer shades of eyeshadows & lipsticks and wear a little less of everything More moisturizer and I only use BB cream it doesn't dry my skin out as much and dark lipsticks so perfect for winter In winter I like to use my bb foundation! & I moisturise more before I put on my bb foundation! I also like to wear a lot of mascara to keep my eyes look bold! I use more bronzer than usual to give off a glow still! I wear darker eye shadows, like dark purples, dark purple is my favourite! & I like to wear dark purple lipstick, red lipstick or nude! I cleanse and exfoliate every morning before I moisturise to keep my skin looking healthy! I moisturize more and use less bright eyeshadows Use a warmer shade of blush and eyeshadow a slightly darker foundation to avoid lolling pale and lip balm because of course they get dried out!! Found a new love for lipstick when my lips lose colour from the chill.
Lots of water and moisturizer!! I change my foundation to a lighter, more pinky tone as my fan fades away :), use less bronzer and use pink shades of blush to make the appearance healthy and warm. Also brighten up my eyes by applying light colours to the inner corners (: I lighten all shades of my makeup, so foundation, eyeshadows etc... But at the same time the shade remains warm and instead of my usual lip gloss and wear lip stick... Love my winter makeup regime :) Lots of lip balm, bold eyeliner and ultra moisturising cream :) Changing from warmer blushes to pale colours like pale pinks and coral also doing the same with lipsticks, then changing my eyes from bright eyeshadows to more brown/neutral or smokey looks, also using a nice shiny highlighter for my  cheeks and nose for that shiny winter frozen glow :) Anamaria Slatinec-Norton Get a deeper more conditioning moisturiser for my face and start out use argon face oil to stop the dryness more and instead of using translucent powder to set my make up I use the finishing spritz :) I also do more of a natural look with bold lip colours and embrace my paleness :) My foundation stays the same although I don't apply as much an also reduce the amount of concealer I put on. I use a translucent powder to set my foundation, and use warmer tones on my eyes and use a little less bronzer. Also I apply blush to make me look more flush then what I really am :)) I apply more skincare and change my eye and lip colour to winter shades I mix rosewater with glycerine and use it as a mist after toning or to set my base. The rosewater helps control the acne and redness, keeps the skin hydrated and it smells good. While the glycerine gives me a boost of moisture. So far, my skin is softer and my pimples are finally under control! Opt for warmer neutral colours and a really good moisturiser, plenty of hydrating products I moisturise more, use a lighter foundation since my skin tone is lighter in the winter and opt for warmer eyeshadow, lip or blush colours. With really thick long black lashes and a perfect red Lip stick (diva by you guys is amazing). Also I try stay away from to much foundation, bb cream with a bit of mineral powder works a treat. i use brown eyeshadow for a more smokey look and amp up the plum lipstick! double the moisturiser to keep my skin hydrated. I usually have bolder lips during winter, so I just invested in Colour Inject -  Make A Wish. First day wearing it and I'm in love!!! Since I'm really pale, I opt for a porcelain finish with my foundation, lightly blushed cheeks, a crisp winged liner and big lashes and a dark red or plum lip. I also fill in my brows (but not like cara!!) and sometimes I'll apply the lightest champagne shimmer to my eyelids for a bit more glam! In winter, lip liner is essential so the dark colours don't bleed off the line. This is different to summer where I try get a bronzed look and more rosy tones :) One word. Hydration I moisturise more, and darken up my lip colours! I use a milk based cleanser and a rose water toner to keep my skin fresh and hydrated :) Change my pink and nude lippies for dark reds :) I get a lighter shade of foundation and put on more cooler shades of eye shadow and lipsticks, I also love my cat eyes in winter... idk why <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> We wrap ourselves in heavy jackets and clothing during the winter, and it shouldn't be any different with our skin. I use a heavier cream versus a lighter moisturiser to keep my skin hydrated. Skin gets more sensitive in the winter so think of a heavier cream as an extra layer of protection ï¿½ ï¿½like a warm sweater.ï¿½ Warmer eyes in browns/taupe, less mascara and brighter lipstick to combat the greyness of winter light. :) I go for a darker lip, and switch up for a more hydrating moisturiser to combat the dryness of winter :) Stay well moisturizer and use a matte finish foundation and lots of lip balm<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098> Full coverage foundation, darker lip colours and ALWAYS making sure i have lipbalms in my hands throughout the day!! :)  A lighter shade of foundation and a swap to translucent powder instead of my usual tinted one, I also switch from natrual lipsticks and glosses to bolder winter colours deep reds and purples etc Warm up my eyes with some natural eyeshadow and add some bold lipstick! By using Australis Cosmetics to help me spruce up my winter look! I wear a warmer toned foundation or BB Cream and use a poppy red or coral tone for lips plum matte lips and a little vintage eyeliner for sure! Lot's of moisturizer, smokey eyes and a opaque lippie Darker colours! Killin them maroon lips! I love to use your colour injection gloss! Gives the perfect finish to a rugged up winter look. A lighter full coverage foundation with a peach blush topped of with gangster rap for dark plum lips! My skim goes really dry in winter so I break out a lot of skin masks and creams. I also wear a lot of browns on my lips. Thicker moisturiser, matte out, with a winged eye and full brow! :) I use a lighter foundation with mineral powder over the top to even it out. Heavier moisturiser, darker nails and a pretty brown eyeshadow look. I always try and use a bit more bronzer to make my skin look warm and also use shades of wine red and deep purple on my lips to match my cosy scarves. I think the key for make up in the winter is to try and make the skin and eyes look brighter so that you don't look like the cold bothers you! I feel like winter allows me to be more experimental with my makeup, in terms of colours. Deeper plum/burgundy lip makeup and a bigger focus on putting colour on to the cheeks to avoid looking pale and sickly looking. Unlike my usual routine, I would apply my eyeshadow with a lighter hand to make my dark lip colour the focus of my look :-)

In terms of skin care, I always need to opt for a more heavy moisturiser or serum/oil to keep my skin smooth and supple Darker colours and lots of moisteriser I change up my routine by having heavier and darker eye makeup and darker everything x i use more moisturising products to combat the dryness caused by the cold and wind. I also choose a foundation one shade darker than usually  because my skin gets quite paler in winter Lighter foundation, & more earthy tones :) I use coconut oil as a moisturizer before I go to bed. Smooths my skin, keeps it moisturized and clears my acne and scaring. In winter I like to use darker lip colours Lip balm and moisturiser when the westerly winds hit. I use rosehip oil under my primer, add my foundation (even in winter I still use a foundation or BB cream with SPF). It hydrates my skin and gives it a nice subtle natural glow. I add a touch of bronzer to my cheekbones, nose bridge and lightly frame my face (basically I like to bronze where the sun naturally hits the face) and  a bit of blush. Line the waterline of my eye in white and add a nice rich brown or bronze to my eye and add lots of mascara and I finish with pawpaw cream on my lips and a red tinted balm over the top. Natural but enough not to look washed out. For winter i especially stock up on lip balm & moisturiser & I love dark burgundy or navy colours for nails (: During the winter I use a thicker moisturiser and a more dewy foundation. I love the dewy look for my foundations. Winter changes the colour of leaves - therefore the colour of my overall makeup look.
Winter brings the chill of cool toned colours and dark shades - purples, dark blues and plums for my eyes and lips. I change my whole routine around colour, everything is darker and richer across the whole palette. Moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! instead of just using a primer and foundation, using moisturiser then primer... I only smudge lipstick on with a finger and then cover in lip balm so lips won't crack and dry out while still having a pretty pout :) In winter I MOISTURISE! Excessively! I tend to use a creamier foundation and even though most people go darker with their makeup in winter, I prefer brighter blush and lippy, because my pale skin tends to look zombie-ish when the sun's not shining :) Moisturize is key! Add in some pale pink cheek hues, a darker eyeliner and add a little dark purple to my nails! Gold and black double cat liner and berry lips! I always moisturise and protect my face from the harsh cold! I have sensitive skin so its helpful! I overdose my lips with lip balm and gloss to keep them moisturised and hide the pale coldness they have during winter! I also loooooove doing bronze/copper eyes with a wispy winged eyeliner to give my face a warm glow! 

I also go for dark, frosty nail colours and love having my hair out to keep me warm. But frizz control is a MUST with curly hair and cold, windy or rainy days!! <3 <3 I add a couple of drops of Rosehip oil into my foundation to keep my skin hydrated and to give it a healthy dewy glow. I lather on the moisturiser, and tend not to wear any foundation due to dry skin, other than that, not much, I tend to brave dark colours during the hot months anyway!. #datgothlife I feel as thought most people use warmer colours for their makeup during winter, so to add some brightness to my brown smokey eye, I use white eye liner on my water line and a nice pop of colour on the lip (either a pearl pink or nude) with a nice gloss Moisture moisture moisture!!! I use darker colours and deeper reds for lipstick, a full coverage foundation is needed. fuller coverage foundation and more sultry, darker colours like purples and browns on my eyes and reds for lips :) I just generally moisturise and prime. Only darker colours like browns and red lips. Tbh so funnily enough I wear bronzer :P I never do this in summer. I want to look warm in winter so brown cheeks and purple lipsrick for me I load up the moisturiser. One that has oil because it lasts a lot longer. I exfoliate the same amount and apply a mask twice as many times. Protecting and soothing the skin. I add extra moisturising all this gold weather dries out my skin! I use a lightly tinted moisturizer instead of foundation to help keep my skin from going dry and use earthy colours  and reds. Moisture and primer. Using a more berry or warm colour in my lips and changing the warmth of the contouring. Darker lip colours, lighter foundation and moisturiser, moisturiser, moisturiser. Never go out without skin care and sun block. I using drop of vitamin C mixing my night cream for face and neck. I love simple make up with beautiful eyes shade and red lipstick. Moisturise moisturise moisturise! And a touch of darker bronze to highlight that winter isn't ruining my tan! Hehe. I add an layer of moisturiser on my cheeks and go for deeper lip colours (Y) Darker colours on my lips and nails and always have a lip balm, to stop my lips from getting chapped in the wind! I change it to less or no foundation cause I like a more natural look for winter. Whereas in summer I love going all out! I add more primer and moisturizer and I wear lots of lip balm. Add bronzer for my pale skin too First of all my skin lightens so much! So I have to switch foundation. I love using more dramatic make up whereas in summer I just like going a bit more natural<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> Moisturize everywhere! During winter I change to more natural tones, like nudes & barely there pinks just to add a bit of colour to my face when I'm adding a scarf to keep warm :) I lighten my foundation and darken my hair slightly by adding red foils, I wear purple or red nail polish and I wear darker lipsticks Love big bold lip colours! <U+2764><U+FE0F> nice plum shades for the eyelids! Big bold lashes!!! <U+2764><U+FE0F> dark nail colours!!! <U+2764><U+FE0F> Use a thicker moisturiser and lip balm! I like to use a vaporiser in the night sometimes so my skin doesn't dry out! Lots of avocado, tee tree, and rose water masks!!! Love coconut oil for my skin and hair! Definitely trim away all the split ends! Deep conditioning heaps<U+2764><U+FE0F> love the hair oils in general! MY WINTER BEAUTY POEM:
The days are shorter,
The nights are darker.
Which is why I choose make-up,
That makes me look brighter.
Red, Orange, Purple and Dark Blue,
Are usually matched with my high heel shoes.
I add glitter and shimmer,
Which catches the light.
And makes me stand out,
Under the moonlight.
I wear primer to make sure,
My make-up wonï¿½t fade away.
Which keeps me looking perfect,
Whilst I dance and sway.
Each night before I go to sleep.
I always apply moisturizer so my skin will keep.
These are the rules for my winter beauty routine.
They keep me looking perfect,
And Keep the Boys Keen! <U+263A> Moisturise day and night, use a deep red blush or a caramel brown bronzer, plus the cute red or brown lips to finish. (: I moisturise so much more during winter and love to make an effort to wear colours on my lips and eyes whether they be deep or bright as winter is often so dull and people often wear such dull colours that it's nice and a bit of fun to throw some colour in there! <U+2614><U+26C4> Winter makeup for me means trading in statement neon brights for daringly bold hues of berry and wine that look as decadent as they sound! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BD><U+0093><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0085><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+0084> Always moisturise... Darker eye makeup and nude lips. Or bold lips minimal eye makeup... Never mix the two. Lighter foundation. I darken my hair. Always love a brown smoky eye. And I recently just purchased some of your lipstick colour called trendy. Such a pretty pink so I have been wearing that to brighten up my face. Looks gorgeous with a brown smoky eye. Dark/nude lips are my winter fave! Moisturise for dry skin but still use SPF during the day as the sun can still damage your skin in winter!  Carmen May Anderson Berrrry evrythang :P Extra moisturising using a moisturiser for dry skin and still using 30+ sunscreen. I stop using bronzer and using a light blush to look wind swept and a darker blush for special occasions. I also use oil in my baths. :) I cant go past a flush of colour on the cheeks and a bright pop of lippy or eye-shadow to brighten up dull days ;) Just coz the sun aint shining doesn't mean we can't shine :) Keep skin hydrated and clear with skin care (Mikil lip conditioner, Baby Lips Lip Balm, Clearlisil gel, moisterizer). Use curling wand to put ringlets all in my hair- hides frizzy. Sharing the love with friends. Keep moisturised with a tinted moisturiser bright lippy and warm colours for eye shadow I always drink plenty of water to keep my skin hydrated. As for my make up. I brighten up my colours so pinks lighter purples lighter greens lighter blues and I glitter up to make a sparkle and shine. As I normally use warmer colours in summer Moisturizing foundation, cream concealer bronzer instead of blush and waterproof mascara for rainy days and watery eyes from the cool wind I tend to need a lighter foundation. My vitiligo is less obvious in winter so I don't need as much which helps :-) I change the eye makeup colours and my lip colours.  And put hair up in a plat Lots of dark lippy! I change to darker colours! and also use dry skin foundation so my skin isnt gross and dry :) but I still use my australis matte primer <U+2661> My motto is PCCP. Prime, conceal/ crï¿½me blush, and plum lipsticks/stains. These four must dos keeping me looking and feeling that tad more fabulous when the weather is not on our side. I have never met a girl who doesn't feel instantly better after swiping on a plum or dark lip on a gloomy day. Tone down my foundation, wear warmer colours to make my face pop against everyone else's pink with cold faces hehe i don't really change anything i always do my makeup however i feel on the day, i dont let seasons get in my way! haha Darker Lip colours and nails to match. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><U+2744><U+FE0F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+008B> Moisturiser! And warm brown in crease makes my eyes pop with a dark lippy for winter :) also love a good contour against the dark lippy I like dark berry colours for my lips with matte powdered foundation (holla australis Ready Set Go and australis primer) and frosted bronzer/blush on my cheeks, i like just basic eyes with colour wash natural gray tones and really precise elegant eyeliner to match the warm winter clothes! and of course a nice warm hot chocolate right next to my lips at all times hehe A rosy colour for my cheeks, instead of peaches ect. and a bolder brow with darker lashes. I like to keep it clean but very defined. I usually head towards darker eyes and lips and love using deeper blush etc to deepen the face structure, make ups so fun! I dont change anything im white all year round lol your summer is still my winter in skin tone terms hahaha Bolder eyebrows, heavier moisturising cream/base and brighter lip colour, otherwise eyeshadow is whatever I feel like that day! I darken up the lips and add more highlight <3 Extra moisturising, darker lip and bronze myself up so I don't look too pale during winter I only add extra latherings of moisturiser and lip balm to my routine. My colours change from bright vibrant colours to more nutural shades to match the season I use a darker foundation to give my face more colour and give myself smokier eyes. i use a night moisturiser...i feel my skin is drier and tighter during winter due to heating. I tend to use more neutral colors during winter too I wear more moisturiser and less eye make up and more lip balm I always use a moisturiser with sunscreen as I live in the NT where it is hot and dry and I find that my skin is so very thirsty, season here makes no difference as it is hot all the time , liked and shared With warmer colour tones for my eyes.  Long black eye lashes and a soft tone lip gloss for extra shine I use extra nourishing creams, lotsa lip balm & add that bit of colour on my lips & cheeks :) I use an intensive night moisturiser as it stops my face from drier out on the cooler mornings I love cooler colours teamed with warm clothing it makes me feel hot! Speaking for my daughter, she changes it daily to keep fresh, different products, ditching the rest I always use light colour tone for my face and smokey color for my eyes and I also intend to use lots of Qv moisturising creams to keep my skin from drying out in the winter season. Just more moisturiser and lip balm to prevent dryness I tend to moisturise more and use  lip balm more frequently, to keep the harsh winter wind at bay.  I also use softer. warmer colours on my eyes as they don't look as harsh on my paler winter skin! Lots of Mascara.  Liked and Shared My winter ritual stays exactly as summer. It works and I'm happy with it, so why change anything! More moisturizer - heating is very drying for the skin. I use more lip balms and moisturizers as the wind dries out my skin Warmer colors for blush and liner and very slightly deeper shade for foundation.  I like the rosy glow the crisp cool air gives to cheeks and I try to imitate that look. Bolder colours , I tend to feel a little flat during winter . Winter Beauty tips I love and use! I wear cotton socks during winter, after i use a foot care cream....to avoid cracked and dry heels. Drink plenty of H20! Use a Cream Blush instead of a Powder in Winter, avoiding flaking and leaving your skin soft and fresh. Remember, Coconut Oil is versatile and a great way to reduce skin problems, leave your skin moisturized and your hair soft and silky in any weather.And lastly, I use a emollient moisturizer straight after i exfoliate and before i put on make up to limit dry and flaky patches from appearing under my makeup. I alpply lots of rose hip all to my face at various times throughout the day I wear warmer, darker colours. Up the amount of colour ..to counteract being paler in winter Extra moisturiser and lots of extra lip balm to combat the harsh cold winds and bonfire burn Moisturise urise, the cold weather dries my skin, moisturiser is a girls best friend... Paw paw cream for my lips as they dry out more and more colour with my make up, a blush instead of a bronzer. I only go with the warm natural colors that winter brings. Buckets of moisturiser (well it seems as though I lather on buckets of it) make me feel normal through winter I wear a snuggly bathrobe and slippers when I do my skincare routine!  Oh and I use a richer moisturiser too. ;-)) Winter makeup secret, drink H2O
Don't dehydrate when youï¿½re on the go
lighter foundation, carry powder around
Weather won't affect, makeup look will astound I wear lighter foundations and more greens and browns on the eyes . No tea or coffee, just hot water I change my foundation colour for Winter as my skin goes very pale and I lose that glow. My skin gets really dry and sensitive in winter so I swap my day moisturiser for a night one. I also use a honey and oat face mask twice a week to help soothe my skin and reduce redness. More moisturiser and warmer lipstick :) More moisturiser and cream or gel based products rather than powders plus I like to throw in some deep berry shades either on my eyes or lips. More moisturiser and water. I change up mt nailpolish and lip colour to more dark shades. Honestly the best thing about winter is being able to rock a dark lip shade any day of the week. <3 as my skin looks lighter i like to contour to give my bones a standout structure while using a nice dark colour pallete for eyes and lipstick give off a nude/tan look in winter a new natural look I love to look all natural and classic tend to use less foundation and more waterproof mascara Warm colours, using brown tones for smokey eye look and a long lasting moisturiser Wear brighter colours to cover my paler skin! more moisturiser (oil free) and darker tones more moisturiser! Winter means maintaining my water intake for hydration, and using an intense moisturiser at night rather than a normal one. Daytime I always use a SPF cream be it summer or winter. Better quality  exfoliator,jojba instead of body oil and foot lotion I use a moisturiser with for extra dry skin as mine is dry and needs that bit more in the winter to keep it looking good. Liked and shared. It's a crime not to prime1 More moisturiser and extra lip balm, to keep my skin hydrated, it works a charm!! Lemon is great for your tea during the winter months, but I also like to grate the rind, add to vitamin e cream and use as a pleasant scrub to keep my skin feeling subtle and fresh (y) Exfoliate and use Rosehip oil on my face and hides the rest ;) I give my lips more treatments and protection because they get so dry with the winter winds. My skin gets incredibly dry during winter, so I make sure I use a thicker moisturiser. I also exfoliate my lips to remove the dry skin lots more moisturiser in winter The only thing I change in winter is I moisturise more often as my skin tends to be a lot drier. I don't really change much except more lip balm to combat the effect on my lips from the wind! Brighter colours on eyes, cheeks and lips to kiss goodbye to the winter blues. Just because it's cold doesn't mean drab. I just use moisturizer more often :) I maintain the same beauty routine all year round. I use a hydrating mist toner and make sure I moisturise twice a day to make sure my skin does not dry out from the cold! Not much, still use bronzer to give me a boost. shower , towel dry,  use a deep conditioning moisturizing body cream to get the most out of your products and protect the skin for winter I use lip balm to look after my lips with all the strong winter winds. I use more moisturiser and warmer colours More moisturiser at night,
And scrubs are a delight.
Winter is filled with dry skin,
Which is a real sin! I experiment! :) To wake up revived, a brand new me, extra moisturiser needed indeed, help skin rejuvenate overnight, skin looks amazing and super bright! boost the moisturiser,(cold air can dry up the skin quicker)smooth skin, simple and successful, thatï¿½s the beauty of it! I still use moisturiser containing a sunscreen during the day, that stays the same all year. But I avoid airconditioned rooms as much as possible as they dehydrate the skin and I drink plenty of water still. I use lip protection from cold winds. I like to use a dry body brush all over my body to exfoliate and stimulate circulation.   It's also a good way to warm up and stretch in the morning!  

I moisturise in the shower using a light sesame body oil or in-shower body lotion.  Much quicker and no need to stand in the freezing cold brrrr!   

For my face I apply a rich hydrating mask once a week to combat the dry winter air and use heavier foundation instead of the lighter tinted moisturiser I prefer in summer  <U+2665> I go for the warmer tones in my make-up and nail polish,use jojoba oil on my hands for extra moisturising and chap stick for my lips I use more makeup period as my skin tolerates it more as its not as oliy in winter I use more moisturizer,
During winter days.
The winter air hurts my skin more,
Than the summer rays.
I have to drink more water,
To keep my skin glowing.
Then no matter what season,
I'll always want it showing!
I moisture my lips,
To keep them looking great!
Australis has saved my life,
It's something I'll never hate.
Nothing worse having dry & cracked skin,
It makes you feel shy.
If you haven't used Australis make-up,
It's something you need to try!
No more dry & scaly skin,
Australis has saved the day.
I love my amazing make-up!
I treasure it in every possible way <3 I use warmer colour to help create the illusion of warmth, helping me to ward off the chill of winter Warmer colours and good moisturiser to keep the skin hydrated. Good diet, plenty of water, cool down the shower and dont exfoliate as much and a great moisturiser We might be getting older, but that don't mean we want our skin to faulter, make sure you eat right and drink water too, so your skin will glow well for you. Moisture every day and night, and you'll be right, using the right australis is what's right for us...its what you put in, that will let you have the best winter skin. Xx Warmer colors and a bronzer to finish those tones. Hydrate and moisturise more, bb cream instead of just mineral powder and deeper richer colours for lips cheeks and eyes"

Just more lipbalm to stop windburn and dry lips :p and moisturizer to stop dry legs and arms etc lots of lip balm and hand cream cos i get dry skin in winter I wear darker coloured eye makeup. As I feel I need to go darker to feel warmer. More lip balm and moisturiser! Because it's about time I start wearing make up. Haven't worn it in years <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+009E> I wear darker lips colours and use more pink blushes and less orange ones! Lip balmmmmmmm I keep some lip balm handy for chapped lips, use lots of good moisturizer and wear earthy colors or a bit of color to brighten things up! Neutral tones with cat wing eyeliner <U+2661><U+2661> Lipstick and thick eyeliner <U+2764><U+FE0F> Lexi Hernandez as my skin looks lighter i like to contour to give my bones a standout structure while using a nice dark colour pallete for eyes and lipstick give off a nude/tan look Use rosehip oil for moisturiser to make sure my skin stays hydrated. apply more moisturiser for my dry skin and go for warmer toned blush, eyeshadow etc.   I wear a deeper lip and less shimmer on my face in general. I like a more matte look. And definitely plenty more lip balm I alternate between using a tinted moisturiser and foundation to change it up a bit so my face doesn't dry out. I also use a pink blush to add some colour to my face so I don't look so pale. Definitely more moisturization! And darker lips Darker eyeshadow and more eyeliner! not sure iif i entered lol but in winter (oor just the colder months) i use a dark lip like the velourlips Pink cheeks,lighter foundation as I love my summer glow :( Earthy colours for my lips and definitely use a primer every time vanilla lip balm and thicker eyeliner  Winter draws out all the moisture, colour and livelyness from my face - so apart from moisturizing and lip-balming for the hydrating base, I make sure to change my primers, foundations and even lipsticks to the more moisturizing kinds to give that extra hydration as it gets cooler, because winter is the time for snowflakes, not skin flakes! I change it up with slightly fuller eyebrows and deeper lipsticks...hoping to start with some plum shades soon :) darker eyebrows, heavier top liner, thicker lashes and a bold lip :) moisturise more, a lighter foundation than in summer and more bronzer for contouring. Moisturise out of necessity and involuntarily stop shaving the legs I Rely on my lip balm religiously :p I love to add bright colour to my nails with Australis nail colour, and as i am fairly pale especially in winter I like to use a colour corrector to brighten my face under my foundation - as a pale face often look a tad tired or washed out. Finally - I like my eyes to pop - so i use australis lash length extensions mascara.....then a hint of gloss on my lips and I am out the door! Plenty of lip balm, hand cream, darker lippy and a matte finish! Sinead McGarrigle Fuller eyebrows, longer lashes, bolder lips stronger contour :D More moisture as skin dries up. I wear darker colours and more bronzer as my tan fades. I moisturise more, use warmer colours in terms of eyeshadow, lip shades, etc. I change up my routine by using a cream instead of a gel primer and also use waterproof mascara, as my eyes water more in the winter time. I also tend to wear more eyeshadows in the winter time Lip balm applied 24/7 alongside tinted moisturiser to make sure my skin and lips don't dry out! Also gradual tanner on my legs which stop seeing the light of day as soon as the cooler weather hits <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> Darker eye shadows and lighter contours with more blush, darker/warmer lips. I use lighter foundations closer to my natural colour rather than being dark/tan I moisturize heaps and I tend to wear a lot more foundations with moisturizer in it. I stick to concealer to cover up any red spots or under eye circles. I like to fill in my brows and use a pinky red tinted lip balm and I'm on my way :) foundation gets lighter, less bronzer (as I refuse to give it up completely lol), colour palette changes from bright/vibrant to more natural cooler hues. Natural lids, extra mascara, matte skin and a really dark lippy c: Moisturise 100x more than in summer and a tad of bronzed to add some colour. But I usually attempt to keep the dewy look I change my lip stick and nail polish colours to deeper shades of nude, grey and burgundy:) Dark lippie <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> more bronzer and more zit zapper!! Pawpaw cream to keep my lips hydrated, soft peach lips with bronze/golden eyeshadow and a touch of bronzed glow <3 biggest tip is to moisturise! Moisturise! Moisturise! Deeper lippy colours and moisturize my skin so much more as it gets so dry! lighter shade of foundation EYESHADOW EYESHADOW EYESHADOW!
change it up, go for more copper colours especially with my blue eyes it lightens them up and makes my face look fresh and add a touch of blush to my cheeks and a streak of bronzer down my nose too define the shape!
<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+00A9><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+00B8> Defs double check my foundation colour! I love going for a wintery look with a nice bright or dark lip Moisturiser of a morning before anything else and lots of extra lip balm. Id start with a thicker moisturiser and definitely a lighter shade of foundation.. Maybe even use less powder to set my makeup as i might get some dry patches in this cold weather A better moisturiser! 
Lighter Foundation and primer to keep it looking flawless all day and some berry coloured lips and big lashes!! Lip balm, moisturiser and eyeliner! Moisturise waaaayy more!! Use light bronzed more lip balm to hydrate those chapped lips. Smokey eye shadow or a light white sparkly shadow with thin top liner and baby pink lips to keep it bright :) if it's not too gluggy outside might put some pink blush in the apples of my cheeks xx Lots of moisturiser  ! Then dark vampy lippys and embracing my true pale skin before the fake tan comes out for summer I change to darker lipstick and lighter foundation A more matte foundation for the Winter and a pop of pink on the cheeks :) a thicker moisturiser and dark lip colours. oh and matte foundation :$ Lighter foundations, darker lip. I switch to a darker lip with a matte finish for a more glamorous look Moisturise as often as possible throughout the day - including hands!!Darker eyeshadows! Usually a dark brown smokey eye!
Tend to apply liquid foundation with a brush and also use a powder also! I a have a winter shade of foundation that is a little lighter.
Either a bright lipstick (I really like your neon ones and the colour 'gangsta rap' if my clothing is dark or I wear a dark shade of red!
In winter I also tend to use a primer a lot more often especially with how my pores react to the change in weather! Dark lips and liner <U+2764><U+FE0F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+0084>. Courtney Urwin Lots of lip balm and high light!!! use primer and moisturiser , along with a lip scrub !
and my go to lippy is velourlips because it stays on all day no matter the weather ! I moisturise additionally in winter and add bath oil to my baths, I also concentrate more on my elbows and knees. Fake tans are also a plus and blush adds a little extra colour to a chilly face. More bronzer more moisturiser and chopstick :) I add a tablespoon of lemon juice to my facial scrub to help boost its natural brightening power and exfoliating action which is much appreciated by winter skin! Bright lips and eyeliner I mix moisturizer with my foundation for fresher, and dewy looking skin as well as dark lips! More moisturiser! I also paint my nails are deep colour but leave one painted gold just to brighten up my look :) no fake tan and light pink blush :) I change my foundation colour, use more body butter and wear as much plum shade lipsticks as possible! go natural with more moisturiser and avoid caking with foundation and powder  
remembering to keep those lips in check with some pawpaw and alot of water intake. I remove my make up each night and make sure I use moisturise properly. Dry skin makes foundation peel. Use a deep hydrating moisturiser and plum-ify them lips. Simple. I use lots of moisturizer, switch to a matte foundation and go for darker lip shades, which I love! Change up the colour palette to more muted deeper tones and extra lip balm to stop chapping! Lots of moisturiser, always prime and a slightly lighter foundation. I always tend to wear darker colors on my lips and eyes.  Oh and a must have is a good lip balm!  Teeny bit of bronzer to stop me lookin like a ghost!! A lighter shade foundation and I swap my bronzer for blush, my pink lippies for reds an I always make sure  I smother my lips in a hydrating lip balm just before bed so I don't wake up like dried prune lol I put more moisturizer on, lip balm to stop my lips from cracking and use a brightening facial scrub. No change to colour palette I'm pale 'll year roubd Lip balm, moisturiser and use hand cream when possible.  If you need to use tissues, try using the ones infused with aloe vera to help prevent sores or irritation. Change to a lighter shade of foundation so I don't get the really obvious make up line. I use coconut oil to soften my skin and also help my eyelashes stay strong and grow. I use frank body scrub to keep exfoliated and I use a lighter shade of foundation and a nice bronzed and blush to match :) Change my foundation shade and indulge my love of a darker moody lip, or a dark smokey eye with a nude lip. Plus where a fuller coverage foundation, the natural look is for Summer! x Darker lips with australis matte me up! Bronzer and primer primer primer dont want the heater to melt my makeup! ;) More hydrating and moisturizing skincare,  more hydrating face masks, no more nail polish on toes as they will be hidden 24-7 Change to a lighter foundation as I'm not as tanned as I am in summer. Use warmer colours and definitely use more lip balm to avoid chapped lips and a nourishing moisturizer to keep my skin from drying out I switch up my bronzer for a blush to avoid my winter morning zombie face ;- ) I change to a lighter foundation and a more hydrating moisturiser. Rose hip oil for removing makeup because it's gentle and hydrating. I cleanse my face more often and go to a lighter foundation :) I don't have enough makeup to change my routine for winter.. .-. I use bronzer to give my face that sunkissed look and I use more lipgloss to keep my lips smooth and kissable. A nice thick night cream to combat the dryness of the heater during the day a lighter foundation is a must! as is a more hydrating moisturiser and a darker lippy. Darker lips at night time. Only good thing about winter Moisturise Moisturise Moisturise Moisturise Lighter foundation, heavier coverage due to the wet weather making it easier for make up to slide off and less powder as this only assists in drying out the skin! Xx Lots of bubble baths and face masks! Pampering is key :) I switch to facial oils at night,  like rosehip oil Extra moisturizer and no bronzer. I like to keep it simple in winter. Different blush and a darker lips :) use a more wintery shade of lipsticks like deep purples and mauves!! also keeping up with a good skin care regime to help with the battle of the seasons!! using a more moisturising lotion ~ To be honest, I dont think I change my beauty routine for each season. I like to keep my skin exfoliated & moisterised all year round. A bonus to winter is that I dont really need to apply anything for eczema & rashes.  Change down my foundation colour, use deeper lip colours (more lipsticks in Winter than glosses) and use an oil to moisturize my face! <3 as skin isn't all tanned & dewy like it is in summertime, i make the most of pale foundation, matte powder, but a little highlighter to add some ""life"" & glow. & of course can go a bit more wild with the rosy pink blush for wintery frosty-wind-kissed cheeks! I've changed my makeup routine by using a darker, lipstick such as a deep red or plum paired with a nice thin line of eyeliner on my eyes (: Using products that give me a more Dewey finish and leaves me moisturised as my skin gets very dry when it's cold :) Moisturizer, eos lip balm, dark shades for lips, neutral nails, bb cream/light foundation, highlight, light blush, netural/dark eyes Moisturize cause of stockings and wear a bit of mascara to bring out the squinting eyes ;) Use a more intense moisturiser, and lip balm at night and always wear blush and colourful lips! Switch up to an amazing, lighter matte foundation, darker, daring eyes and a sexy dark red lip! Also a lighter, more natural powder to contour rather than a sunkissed bronzer.  Finally, lots'a lip balm to keep those babies hydrated! More water a serum before mositurising to repair any damage from the cold weather more primer and brighter lipstick! I use darker shades of lipstick and also use blue and white eye shadows I use moisturiser and i use a darker shade of lipstick over lipbalm. I also use a cream colour liner to line my lower lash line to brighten up my eyes. Intense moisturizer to stop my skin from drying out so much, and a lip balm aswell! :) more bronzer to keep me from looking washed out and rosy blushes :) Moisturise ! And lip balm :) darker colours ! I use a good serum and moisturiser, keep my make up simple and stay vigilant with a healthy diet tend to use less foundation and use waterproof mascara more. I usually don't, so that is why a makeover pack would help me :) I make sure I eat lots of warm veggies, drink lots of water to prevent dehydration from the indoor heating, and use a night cream. Darker colours on eyes and lips and Moisture Moisture Moisture Use much more primer, bronzer, blush, moisturiser and body lotion!  Haha Moisturiser in the microwave warms it up so my face is warm when I walk out the door Lots of moisturizer ,  smokey eyes , pink lips and pink nails  to brighten up a cold day! :) I use darker shades on my lips and use my Australis highlights pearl liquid highlighter mixed in with my foundation for a dewy glow <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+0084> a moisture rich moisturizer as my skin gets very dry. also as my foubdation shade is lighter in winter due to no tanning, I opt for a heavier contour and bronzer and also a purple/pink blush to add a natural looking flush into my cheeks and put some life into my face. if it's a night out look I pick up my favourite deep burgundy lippy and I'm ready to go! less foundation, more moisturizer ^-^ I lay off the bronzer in the winter and thicken up on the moisturiser! Mixing up between tinted moisturiser and a quality foundation day to day helps the skin recover and become moisturised for those cold, dry winter days! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008C>
A bold lip stick for a splurge of colour, a light blusher for the cheeks to add some warmth to the skin tone, and long luscious eye lashes with black mascara are defiantly a must , and all together =  winter perfection <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C><U+26C4><U+FE0F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><U+2744><U+FE0F> The razor seems to comes out less, but the moisturizer comes out more. Also a lighter foundation or BB cream, it doesn't sweat off in winter. Liked and shared with love x A little bit of bronzer is great to give you that healthy glow. I have to wear more foundation because otherwise I look like a snowman (y) More moisturiser, more colours and more highlighter to brighten up a dull winter day! Plenty Moisturiser, topped with a luscious primer and finished off with rosy red cheeks and lips to add some colour to my pale complexion.

Inner eyeliner

Extra moisturiser   
Red nails Heaps more moisturisers I use a much heavier moisturiser and darken my lip colour selection : ] i would use a lighter foundation, use more blush to keep the cheeks rosy and warm during the winter, keep my eyes as natural as possible and i would use thicker lashes A heavier moisturiser, exfoliate more, pretty pink blush, more natural eyes, extra coats of mascara, and making the most of the on trend plum/purple lipsticks :) In shower moisturiser wash! A hint of bronzer to define my cheek bones and big curls! more lip balm, less mascara <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00B3> Add a little bit of eyeshadow and some fierce eyebrows and winged eyeliner <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098> sometimes a red or dark pink lippy to spice things up never know who your going to bump into ! I use a darker,lip stick colour and make my cheeks a little rosier I mix my normal foundation with a lighter one because I'm too pale for my darker one.
I usually wear a bright red lipstick or a smokey eye.
I also wear a pinky blush as to add colour back into my cheeks. Lotion, serum, essence, hydration, moisturise! Lighter foundation, purple and blue tone of eyeshadow, pink blush, curls, more mascara and light toned lips BB cream instead of foundation, bolder lips darker colours and simple eyes just a few coats of mascara and also light bronzer to contour :) Always moisturise your face and hands before you sleep! Your skin will thank you for it in the morning Lighter foundation glossed up lips and moisturizer everywhere ignore the makeup and wrap up in all things warm and cozy... and stay in bed a lot when it's cold... yup :)  if i have to go out i'll go for eyeliner because my eyes are pretty much the only thing you'll be able to see under my hoody and scarfe A dewy foundation so my skin doesn't look so dull! Warmer shades on the eyeshadow and light lipstick. My skin gets kinda pasty looking and very dry, so I change the shade of my foundation, and pick a lighter kind of formula, so it's not so cakey and drying for winter, ill also use extra moisturiser. I use for moisturiser and take better care of my skin because it gets dry really easy change my foundation to something more the colour of paper, and bust out the colourful lipstick! I make sure to stay extra hydrated through winter. Both externally with moisturiser and internally with lots of water! This protects my skin from the harsh winter air/heaters/sun/frost/rain/pollution with minimal effort on my part! Huzzah! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> I drink plenty of water to help my skin stay hydrated from within and use a heavier moisturiser to combat the extra drying effects of the harsh winter weather. Starting with a moisturizer then adding primer. This hydrates and preps the skin for foundation. Also adding warm tones to the eyes and cheeks such as a taupe and darker brown for the eyes and A subtle contour to the cheeks adding warmth. 
I also use a brown eye liner for my lower lash line instead of black to soften the look. 
I finish with a finishing spray that helps everything last loner and also hydrates. Bronze tones on the lids, warm lips and moisuriser and primer to protect from the cold and give a flawless base. Bb or cc cream, with a bit of blush and illuminating powder/highlighter on the high points of the face, lots of lip balm, and a dark plum/raspberry lipstick for going out I have now changed it to my moisturiser my nude press powder for that glow I love<3 and my aleovera under eye treatment for baggy eyes as the cold does this to me and my moisturing baby lip blam my maybelline<3! lots of moisturising, especially hands, apply lip balm throughout the day, dark nails and lips :) feathered eyebrows  &a  vampy lip colour  :) Loads more moisturizer and less powder I love the Dewey look Hydration! Lots of hydrating masks, a thicker night cream and eye cream. And I take a break from fake tanning and buy a lighter foundation shade <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> False lashes so I dont need to worry about mascara, moisturiser, less powder, lip balm to protect my lips, warmer colours like plum/dark red lipstick or a smokey eye, false tan so I keep my healthy glow and well groomed eyebrows! And then remember to wash it all off before bed so my skin stays beautifully fresh! Wearing sexy trackies <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0089> Rebecca Pappa I use earthy colours to make my blue eyes pop more! Moisturising my face is key when doing my winter makeup. I also change up eyeshadow colours to slightly lighter toned colours. Lip balm is also a must have or just a lip product that's soft and soothing on them with a pop of colour. switch up the colours to warmer browns, oranges, anything to make myself and others feel warmer in the cold days More moisturizer and a good night serum! Gotta have a good base to work with <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D> I moisturise a lot more than summer, lighten my foundation and break out the pink lipstick! Swap powder foundation to liquid and a rose cheek to brighten up my un-sunkissed face <U+263A><U+FE0F> Keep up with hydration and drink more water Plenty of serum, moisturiser and water. Also a dark lip, because who doesn't love a dark lip in Winter? Intensive repair lip balm to protect and nourish my lips <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+008B>
Plum lipstick does the job to add some winter colour <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> I mix a lighter foundation with a darker foundation to get my winter foundation shade. I like to use a different blush also to get the frosty cheeks look, since the sun is gone I use a dewy finish spray for a bit of a fresher face look :) Rather than using my brown or black liner i go for an indigo or electric blue just to put some colour into my day! heavier moisturiser (especially for the lips) Use lip balm to prevent lips drying as well as thicker moisturising lotion Moisturiser, moisturiser and more moisturiser. Hydrating the skin in winter is so important, the wind soon leaves skin feeling dry and parched, so rehydration using night cream, eye cream and under foundation day cream (with SPF) works wonders for me. I use  brighter lipsticks (red and burgundy tones)  with lip gloss, bronzed foundation, darker eyebrow and mascara in winter. The brighter makeup jazzes up black, beige and brown outfits...now I'm ready to face the world!!! A daily facial of honeydew melon and avocado. Liked n shared jus stay hydrated and use moisturizer Use a bit of colour on my lips I use my l'oreal lumi magique primer more to keep my face moisturized! I find in the winter my skin gets a lot drier x Go from bright lippies to dark purples & plums! Go from a matte foundation to a dewy one to avoid over drying my skin Heavier moisturiser, beautiful purple and silver eye shadows Moisturize! using a night cream as well, During winter I like to give my face a break from the heavy foundations needed to live the summer away and wear bb creams and tinted moisturizers instead, My skin thanks me for it! Moisturise three times more and go big and bold in terms of colour!!! Keep my lips moisturised against the winter wind....lipstick! Wear a full face of makeup with bright red lippy to brighten up a winter day! <3 I have to change to a lighter foundation as my skin doesn't see much sun in winter I use a lighter foundation as I am paler during winter, but darken my eyebrows and eye shadows xx I use a slightly darker foundation as I'm very pale, and I wear warmer colours (eyeshadow, eyeliner ect.) I use double the amount of body moisturiser to help combat the effects of the cold weather drying out my skin. I always wear a shader lighter of foundation during winter and also put on some heavier moisturiser as my skin tends to dry out more in the cold weather I add bright lip colours in for winter! Brightens my day x Matte is my fave at the mo, hot pinks, ruby reds, corals - mmmm love a good lippy xx Moistening lip sticks and lighter foundation with thinker winged liner Mositurising my face and lips.wear eyeshadow darker to bring out winter look more so colour like blue and white and I would wear dark brown lip stick and leave my hair out to keep my head warm  use a good quality moisturiser and serum to hydrate the skin Lighter foundation and a more dense moisturizer. More night cream, more body lotion, less toe nail polish and shaving of legs. We wrap ourselves in heavy jackets and clothing during the winter, and it shouldn't be any different with our skin. I use a heavier cream versus a lighter moisturiser to keep my skin hydrated. Skin gets more sensitive in the winter so think of a heavier cream as an extra layer of protection ï¿½ ï¿½like a warm sweater.ï¿½ I add some bright lippy.  Melbourne winter is grey and dull and we all need some colour in our day Definately Bright lippys , never a dull moment even in winter , and definately hydrate more with loads of water and a all natural moisturiser , also I never leave the house without a sensational spray perfume , especially the floral smells <3
The harsh winter wind,
Dries out my poor skin.
So I drink lots of water,
To put the moisture back in. Extra moisturizer to protect against the wind well i go into shaving hibernation, just to take extra precaution but i also where a light peach lip stick as the cold weather makes me cheeks a little red so i like to keep my makeup more natural, even opting for a clear mascara to make me eyelashes more softer <3 I use extra moisturizer so my skin doesn't dry out Use more moisturiser :) I do have oily skin and sometimes flaky.. Use a darker lippie to get in the winter vibe! x Have to use primer because in winter I have really dry skin compared to summer where it's practically an oil factory but I use bright colours on my lips I like to brighten up the day with a pop of colour getting up in the morning in winter makes me grumpy and fun colours are awaking and joyful :D I use a lighter shade of foundation because I lose my tan. I am much more vigilant about cleaning my nightly ritual of cleansing and applying moisturiser I make the switch from bronzer to blush. 
The tanned from a can look in winter will have you looking fake. 
Whilst warm cheeks and a great smile is the best way to capture the eyes of your crush. Pink tones of eyeshadows for a soft look I like to keep my make-up light in Summer, but during Winter I use a day moisturiser as a primer so my makeup is flawless and my skin stays hydrated! Following make-up artists on YouTube, like LAUREN CURTIS, is always a great way to find make-up tips and ideas! She is a great Australian make-up artist and often uses AUSTRALIS make-up! This video will show you one of the many ways I change my make-up routine to suit the cold winter months!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy21dseavP0"

Red lips Moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! 1. Clean with cream cleanser; 2. Tone skin with toner; 3. Add a drop of rosehip oil and lavender oil then mix with moisturiser. Lots of moisturiser! <U+2661> With a slightly more matte foundation, rosey cheeks, winged eyeliner, lashes and berry lips <U+2661> Make sure I use more facial moisturizer and lots of face masks and lip balm! I use moisturiser 3 times.a day during winter to prevent dry skin and cracking :) it works as my skin is amazing Extra moisturising! Winter brings on many changes in my beauty routine from makeup to skin care - moisturising is as essential as sunscreen in summer; so my primers, foundations and lip products have to be extra hydrating to quench my skin in winter. As winter is cold and dull I love to change the colour palette of my makeup too: bring on bold lips and pronounced eyes that pop through the winter haze. Primer under make-up, richer formula for my foundation and creme eyeshadows and blush, richer colours for lips and eyes and a deeper pink flush on my cheeks instead of a bronze Lighter foundation with a lovely bright lip colour for that pop of warmth! I like to use a heavier moisturiser or dewier foundation then do a dark lip. more and more lipbalm :) :) :) i loooooove makeup!!!!!!!! More moisturiser and lipbalm! Warmer colours like reds and bronzes! I moisturise regularly and make sure I never forget the primer under my foundation and I like to sometimes use waterproof mascara in case it rains <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0083> I stop using bright lips :) I like to use more moisturising things on my lips so they don't dry out x I also like to wear warmer tone nail polishes. BB cream and concealer for dark circles. Less bronzer, more peach blush, pink and burgundy tones for lipstick, grey and pink smokey eyes and alot more facials. I keep it natural but have a bold red lip to keep it classy. More water to keep my skin hydrated ,I stay quite natural over winter a little mascara and lip gloss and moisturizer goes,a long way and can make anyone look a million  dollars  :-D I swap out the Australis Matte powder (which is great with my summer bronzer), for the Australis Fresh and Flawless, which is a little softer looking with my blush. I use a pencil eyeliner instead of my usual liquid, and just do half the top outer eye for a more delicate look. I use more mascara and softer, more natural autumn coloured eye shadows (like the one above) and I wear lots of more natural light pink lipsticks. :) I use a heavier moisturizer and also exfoliate and moisturize my lips a lot more so they don't dry out A more dewy foundation finish over matte and more blue and purple eye shadows over bronze. Lip balm is an absolute must! I love using the combo of BB cream and bronzer in winter too highlight and have a dewy look to brighten up my face, adding a bright lippy to add colour to those wintery gloomy days!! xx There's nothing I love more in Winter than my electric blanket but it dries my skin so I moisturise daily. I play around with different eyeshadow colours and lipsticks since I don't have to worry about my makeup melting off, haha. Also because I tend to stick to darker, more plain clothes when it comes to Winter, so I want my makeup to stand out more. In winter I like to switch out my light moisturizer for something a little heavier. Add an extra coat of mascara and ditch the summer gloss for a rich berry lippy. I apply more moisturiser and I wear darker lips Warmer based eyeshadows and deeper lip colour with bold eyebrows Darker plums and ox blood colours for lips, with natural eyes. Or a sheer dark pink-red with brown and gold smokey eyes during the day, so it's not too intense, and sometimes winged liner. Then load up on mascara and apply a rose gold/white liner to make my eyes appear brighter. Clean simple. Making my eyes pop with a catseye... Natural pink lippy and bronzer dreaming of my summer tan I apply more moisturizer to my skin and always apply my BB cream and dewy foundation to finish. Much more use of lip ecfoliant lip balm, moituriser and primer plus some finishing spray dont want my make up to run in the rain :) I love winter make up can pull out cool blue and purple colours for lips and eyes and i always warm up my cheek colour Always wear brighter nail polish and eye shadow in winter to brighten things up a bit. A softer, smokey cat eye and using an illuminator for a dewy glow! I switch my lipstick to tinted lip balm to make sure they're soft and kissable, and I switch my powder foundation for creams and serums for extra hydration :) Bright pink lippy, smoky eyeliner cat eyes, and bb cream <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0097><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0083><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0097> During winter I have dull sunlight in my bathroom... often leads to mistakes with blending foundation. Thankfully I can sneakily tuck this tragic makeup mishap behind a scarf! Skip the bronzer and exam Skip the bronzer and wear more blush. Once Winter hits I swap in a luminzing primer, break out the vampy lipsticks and keep my skin uber hydrated and exfoliated. I love winter! replace bronzer with blush. also have my eyes darker. I love shades of pinks and subtle greys to warm me up for winter and leave off the powder used in summer :) Yesterday went to the hairdressers had my eyebrows waxed and a new experience my upper lip waxed a few hairs near my nostriles. I use a mist during the day when not wearing any makeup...scented but still additional moisture for the skin I switch it up by using darker lippies and more moisturier! I use winter as a time to improve my skin - I focus on deeper moisturizing and masks.  In the summer, I often don't want to put anything on my skin as I am just so hot, so winter is my time for skin improvement. I like to switch to a stronger mosituriser in winter and to a bold red lip to brighten the cold winter days I probably moisturise my face and body a lot more in the winter because my skin gets a lot dryer from the cold weather.I use more honey balm mainly before I go to bed so that my lips stay nice and smooth :) Burgundy and deep red lipstick,  with browns for eyeshadow and light contouring! And strong eyebrows I change my makeup into brighter colors like powder puff pink lipgloss and a nice blusher and light colored nail polishes I swap my lip gloss to lip stick to make my lip colour stand out a bit more, i'll swap my skin colour blush to a pale pink just for my own creation of a winter look ( and also to go with my winter clothes), i swap skin colour eye shadow to a pink to match my winter clothes aswell and and swap my normal skin bronzer to a darker colour to make me look more tanned to catch up without much sun. #fingerscrossed <3 The bronzer gets replaced by rosy pink cheeks. There's nothing worse than a fake orange winter tan! MY WINTER MAKE-UP ROUTINE FOR COLD NIGHTS OUT WITH CLOSE FRIENDS!

1. Apply primer and foundation.
2. Apply blush or bronzer to enhance your cheekbones.
3. A Smokey eye always looks best with all outfits.
4. Apply a bright coloured lipstick to bring colour to your face! i change up to my pale foundation (have lost my natural summer glow lol) , and use warmer toned eyeshadows and lipsticks... :) I have to change my foundation colour an powder
I go with more red an nudes colours 
An just browns <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0080> really want to try out that new full on foundation. I change up my beauty routine by using a darker Color lippie, applying intense moisturizer because my skin gets really dry in the winter and i also use a cream color liner on my waterline to brighten up my eyes :]. I use white eyeliner to outline the bottom of my brow, the inside of my bottom lash line and the inner corner of my eye. Helps me seem more awake when all I want to do is sleep! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00B4> I use a richer night moisturiser with a serum underneath as my skin gets drier, also use a lip balm underneath lippy - usually a dark nude lip shade for winter or sometimes a light plum shade and switch to a cream blush. During winter I exfoliate and moisturise alot more than I do in the warmer months. I tend to opt for dark smokey eyes, using pencil rather than a liquid eyeliner and I use a volumising mascara. I use blush and bright red lipstick shades for this look. Sometimes I also blend bright colours into the smokey eye to make things a bit interesting and keep the rest of my face subtle. Make sure you stay hydrated, and moisturize.. Its easy to get dry, cracked skin from the cold air to the heated office or homes.. Taking that extra care now in winter will give me extra glowing skin for summer xx Lots of lip balm and slightly lighter foundation. Add a deep berry lipstick. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C>"

Finish with liquid eyeliner and mascara then bam! :) for those of us with glasses.  Magnifying mirror!  You don't want to try and do that around the piddly little flip down glasses thing! Good Brushes and a good base :) Lots of black but blend blend blend! And if necessary look up YouTube tutorials Blend properly using good brushes and I always do a sparkly white inner corner! Makes the smokey eye pop! Blend blend blend untill its to ur desire then eyeliner for the cats eye and mascara to finish.. :D Super fluffy brushes! with an excellent base of course! Blending and quality brushes will be your best friend! =) Line your eyelids thick with black pencil liner then blend out with a brush until the line isn't harsh and also under the eye on the lower lash line.Blend with your choice of colours,line with black liner,and slap on some rocking mascara and ta da!! Really good brushes but also picking a colour that makes your eye colour stand out.... Looks amazing when done properly!! I start with a base color and then work the darker color from the outer corners inward.. I find a smaller fluffy brush is the best for blending.. Then I incorporate the other colors in the middle, blend again and then pop in a highlight color in the inner corner.. Then pull the eye taught and line away. Remember when working with darker colors to ALWAYS tap off the excess on your brush before applying or you will end up looking like a panda and having to re-do all your make up! Blend properly and go for deeper shades instead of black if you're a beginner!<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008B> I use grey on my eyelid and blend shimmery black on the corners :) and mascara and eyeliner.! Different browns with some black eye liner and a good blending brush. A good base, and good brushes Use primer under all the shadows to make the blending part easier, and make the make up last longer. Use good quality brushes and blend. And go for lots of lashes. blend blend blend. oh and great brushes ! Blend for your life! Also doing eyes before the rest of your face because fall out takes the best of us, despite tissue shield attempts Use matte shades as a base, then put shimmery colours over top for more intense colour eyeshadow primer and really blend in your eyeshadow with a good brush :) use good brushes and darker eye shadow in the corners and blend out well then finish with a eye liner and bold lashes :) Blend blend blend and use light to dark don't go straight into with black and yes please with the kit!!:) A pencil liner below the eye and liquid liner above. Great brushes to blend the eyeshadow and beautiful dark mascara Smokey eyeshadow, blend blend blend! Mascara and eyeliner <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095> Makeup brushes and blending is key! never have harsh lines, use soft shimmers and less is more :) mascara and then placing glitter on your eyes lashes plus a bit of eye liner I think looks superb ;) Use a pencil liner first and then use a dip liner and finish off with a liquid liner. You need to have lighter shades of nude colours in the center of the eye lid and darker black colours on the outer eyelids. Make sure the blend of transformation is even. Finish off with a mascara and curl your eyelashes Blend like there's no tomorrow! I find a dark Grey eyeshadow with a kohl eye line makes for the perfect smokey look  Lots of blending with brushes and adding eye liner for definition <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> Blending and smudging but be careful! Start with the lightest colour and blend outwards/darker colours :) also a cat eye is a must for me. Start with a good eye primee Choosing a colour that make your eyes pop is key Be sure to use a Smokey grey eyeliner and dark brown eye shadow with pearlessence Blending n good brushes. And deep shades Apply sticky tape to help have sharp lines + it wont look as messy :) to get a vry good smokey eye, is to NOT start with a black shadow as it will be hard for you to lend it well with a lighter transition shade. Good quality brushes to create a perfect blended lid, with a darker crease and outer v, lining the bottom waterline with eye liner and gently blending that liner into the lower lash line :) Blend well! Don't be afraid to use your (clean) fingers!  I don't believe in rigid rules when it comes to makeup - if brushes aren't doing the trick, use an index finger to blend and smudge. A decent blending brush :) Awesome fluffy brushes and nice liquid eyeliner :) Eye shadow primer! And blending brushes a must Apply eyeliner before the shadow, and reapply it afterward. It is more defined, and you have a perfect ""stencil"" to go over. Good products, make sure all brushes are clean and pencils etc sharpened Add a pop of navy for the perfect smoky eye! Eyeliner, mascara & the perfect blend from a smokey palette! Even false eye lashes for that wow factor! X good brushes and quality make up. a good base colour and make sure you blend correctly After all the smokiness and dark colours, pop a light highlight colour in the inner corner to brighten my eyes up a bit so it's not all dull and makes them appear bigger than they look. Good make up brushes. Start with light shadows, blend well, gradually building to a darker well blended finish. Use the lightest shadows at inner corner to darkest in outer corner method. Works every time for any smokey eye look! use a good base and lots of blending! Eye shadow primer and blending! :) I always have makeup wipes on hand to wipe off any mistakes or get rid of fall out. Even though this will remove my base makeup in the area, I can normally apply concealer/powder in the area afterwards and it gives a fresh finish. Use gel liner for your base in the the outer corner and then apply your eyeshadow powder I don't always do it the same way lol.. The best look is achieved if you use an eye primer first and then apply light base colour.  I work form the inner corners to the outer and then liquid liner.  I always end up layering on a few more times afterward until I get the right look.  Sometimes I get my silver shimmer eye shadow and using my finger tip apply that to the inner corners of my eyes Good brushes, and lots of dark brown and black shadow blended in instead of linew, then a really subtle flick :) Eyelid Primer and blending the shadows together. Starting with a base colour first to set the foundation for all the rest.practice makes prefect <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> Blend blend blend :*  blend well Good brushes and eye shadow primer! Use a transition colour around the outside of the dark to warm the look up and of course transition the smokiness (something creme brulee or peach smoothie from makeup geek is ideal)... and of course blend blend blend!! blend and shade!!!! awesome brushes Always start with a light hand :) you can build up! Also do you're eye makeup before foundation! Fall out gets everywhere with smokey eyes. add a liquid eyeliner wing once you're done! Sigmas E40 blending brush is a must! liquid eyeliner once you're done! get someone who knows what to do to do it for you :P Use a good blending brush and lots of eyeliner =) Use a good primer so your smokey eyes stays on all night. Use a shimmery dark brown on the lid and brush a black/blue creating a V shape around the outer corner. Keep blending until you get a soft airbrushed look :) The right brushes! Blend blend blend You can never do too much blending! Less is more.. :) make sure to always blend!!  Have a good primer and start small and build your way up!!! A good blending brush aswell as a smudging ""tool"" also practice! Liquid liner, black/glittery eye shadow and a really good brush to blend to get that sexy smokey affect ;) The best smokey eye is a result of good pigmented product, good brushes and most important is blending! Choosing colours that suit both your outfit and your eye colour can help tremendously too My best tip for creating the perfect smokey eye is always use tape from the bottom of your lash line and up, so the eyeshadow doesn't go where its not supposed to and it gives a nice defined look as well also make sure you always blend well! my trick is all about the right brushes, blending and smokey eyeliner Good quality make up, lots of practice and plenty of blending :-) Blending black! Build and blend!!! Smudge a little its always good to blend Make it all blend well :) xx Blend it do it all first and then through the middle put a grey from the corner of your eye to half way of your eyelid. It will look more dramatic and better. Jjust start with the light shades then, medium shades, then build the dark matte shades to gradually build your smokey eyes. From going light to dark, reduces the chances of messing up or accidentally adding to much dark eyeshadow. I'd recommend a matte dark shade, just so the shadows get enhanced when taking photographs, it's won't/shouldn't  reflect cuz it shouldn't be shimmery. So use the light/shimmery/sparkly shades last as a top off finishing coat on the middle/center of the eye lids & a matte/slightly shimmery - (can always use your pinky finger to glide off any excess glitter) highlighting the brow-bone and near the tear ducts to catch the light! AND ALWAYS BLEND, BLEND with a really soft fluffy eyeshadow brush! make sure the top & bottom of the eyes are evenly balanced with eyeshadow! line the top & bottom of the eyes for extra definition, liquid liner is recommended for the top lash line just so the eyeliner lined before doesn't smudge off because liquid liners are smudge-proof! And finishing of with a few coats of waterproof mascara to hold the eyelashes curled. Use new brushes and blend. Light inner corner to dark outer corner.  Use liquid eyeliner and mascara. Blend it thoroughly so the  lines don't look harsh x A good primer & keep blending First apply the liner creating a flick towards the end of the eyebrow, then apply your shadow blending very carefully and so you can get it even to the line, also apply shadow on undereye line too. Apply as much Mascara as you wish after curling lashes 3 times. Then repeat the eyeliner all around the eye including flick. Re apply shadow to add depth, then I like to go over the lids and flick with a black sparkling liner. Perfect!!! Buy good brushes! cant do a proper smokey eye with a bad brush :-) good blending brushes! and a light inner corner, to keep your eyes open and apart, you dont wanna look like youve got squinty eyes. end in cat eye eyeliner and flared lashes, tada! Light colour first then darker colour working from outside to middle.. Never go past the pupil! Then blend blend blend!! U can never blend to much! Then eyeliner and mascara if u have sensitive skin, always moisturise first!!  Stops u itching ur eyes and then smearing your nice eyes =) Light eyeshadow on the inner eyelid and dark on the outer and blend well. Finish with black mascara and blunt eye liner pencil. Blend blend blend! Use a brush designed to blend and use a good primer Create a smokey eye using vibrant shades that bring out the colour of your eyes. For example shades of purple for hazel and green eyes. This gives a modern take on the classic look and is stunning. :-) Quick and easy smoky eyes using Australis cosmetics! Apply cream concealer to eyelids first. This a good base so that the eye shadow doesn't rub off during the night! Next line your top and lower lashes with eye liner and use an eye liner brush to smudge the liner. Then apply brown eye shadow and sweep the colour across your eyelid, blending into the crease, continue to blend the eye shadow upward and outward on eyelids. Now use ivory eye shadow and brush it over your brow bone. To finish off your smoky eyes, apply two coats of mascara to eye lashes. Now you are ready for a night out! :) Light colour 1st then darker shade , good blending light shade inner & dark shade outer with good bursh & apply primer 1st :) :) Less is more! Always begin with a little bit of eye shadow and gradually build it up. Remember, more can be added later, but it's much more difficult to remove a particular amount of eye shadow, once it's been applied. Less is more! Always begin with a little bit of eye shadow and gradually build it up. Remember, more can be added later, but it's much more difficult to remove a particular amount of eye shadow, once it's been applied. Blending is key. Blending provides the ""smokey"" effect, and plus, it looks unprofessional if eye shadow has just been 'packed on'. Always clean up under the eye after you've finished your smokey eye, with concealer or foundation that has been left over on your brush. Eye shadow usually have some fall out, which can make you look like you have bags under your eyes. Hence, to polish the entire look, clean up under the eyes with concealer or foundation to really make your eyes stand out! :) Utilising a primer before applying any eye shadow at all, will definitely ensure that your smokey eye lasts all night long :) To blend out a smokey eye, never use a colour that is darker or as dark as the eye shadow applied on the lid. Always utilise a colour that will provide a smooth transition from the dark eye shadow to your crease, and then your brow bone. For example, when doing a black smokey eye, a neutral shade of brown will seamlessly blend out the black eye shadow. For a soft smokey eye, bronzed browns and golds are the best! & so glamorous! :) xx"

Blend, blend, blend! Have a smooth base so your eye shadow wont crease. Use tape or shadow shields on the outer V sort of area so it doesn't get messy. You can use a black eyeliner & line the lash line & the outer V & smugde with finger or blend with a blending brush, also line the water line use a black eye shadow & pat it over the base colour, use a lighter colour next to the black & use a white in the inner corner of your eye to open up the eye & also on the brow bone.

Full coverage foundation always helps too & a really goods mascara aswell :) Prime your eyes! & Never forget to blend xx Definatly blending!!! Xxx Always, always prime that way it's actually going to last and doesn't become smudged over the hours which will otherwise make you look like you kissed a panda!! :) You will definitely notice a difference over the hours if you do not prime. Prime first then blend evenly & gently ... Prime your lids, use a really good blending brush and for a nice crisp line use tape at the corner of your eyes that will also help you to create the perfect wing priming and blending and patience use a primer and a dark creamy base. take extra time to make sure your blending is flawless! use tape on the outer part of your eye to make sure the shadow doesnt end up everywhere. also do your eye makeup first so you can clean up the fallout. dark colors are horrible to clean up once your foundation is already done! Keep a nice bright white or silver on the inner eye to open the eye up, blend the colours together!! 
But more importantly, practise the liquid eyeliner to perfection on the top eyelid ;) Always prime :) i use a primer first the use a light amount of eyeshadow and then Blend the colours well and I like to top it off with long and thick eyelashes and eyeliner prime first, blend colours, be patient and use white on the inner eye to open the eyes up, practice makes perfect,love to win :) Primer and blend a lot! Just blend like crazy! and then when youre done BLEND SOME MORE (: Blend blend blend! Transition colour in the crease to avoid harsh lines! Blend well!! Use Australis intensifeye for the perfect smoky eye, blending from the crease and creating a bold and intense look.

The water on the brush helps the colour stay vivid for longer! And finish with mascara of course! My biggest tip is blend blend BLEND! And practice to find out what shape and darkness suit you! :) BLEND My tips are GOOD brushes, take your time! And blend, blend, blend! making sure to blend and use a good eyeliner :) Pick one colour and its shades that make your eyes pop,layer from light to dark and blend well. Practice an blend! Make sure that the shadow starts from the crease in the eye, and that the lighter colours are on the inside of the eye, slowly blending out to grey and the black such fun playing with eyes if you want to be different, start with the darkest colour on the inner corner and gradually go lighter on the outer. also choose a colour that will make your eyes pop (purple-green eyes,blue-brown eyes, grey-blue eyes) best tip is blending it out heaps and starting out with not too much product! Black is good but sometimes I like to change it up a bit with different colours and make sure to blend properly Blend, blend, blend...and then blend some more! Practice! Be gradual and blend! put eyeliner on the top eyelid as well as the bottom Blend and extend :) Practice and use light to dark colours build it up don't got straight in with black because its harder to remove:( yes please for the kit
Thanks australias!!:) lots of blending! Blend blend blend! & it always pays to use a light hand AND to add a little product at a time. That way if you need more you can add more (better than adding a whole heap all at once) :P Layer and build your colours dont just go in with a block colour Seek advice on colours from the Australis beauty consultant, practise, then use with care and sparingly until the smokey eye effect is perfected. Blend well so you get that classic smokey eye look :) Practice Practice makes perfect, I'm still learning all the time but I'm getting better.  I find dark colours and a really good eye liner and blend."

And shinmery black on the edges and under the eye! a good base to start!  and of course a blending brush Start of with neutral colors so any mistakes aren't as noticeable,  apply a base colour and add deeper shades into the crease for depth.  Don't go Straight for the darkest colors!  Build them up and blend blend blend.  Remember you can add more easily but you can't take it back off very easily!  You can never blend a smokey eye too much!!! :) Make sure you have enough time to do it properly and not slapping it on in a hurry... Use a light hand and start with light colours. That way mistakes can easily be fixed  Blend, blend, blend- a perfect smokey eye is always seamless! Start from light to dark and build your colour, and blend, blenddddddddddddddd You just have to blend !
So simple and easy to do <3 Light colour first over entire eyelid, medium colour outside to middle, dark colour outside of eye, blend, mascara and wallah :) gorgeous! Cellotape for smoky cat eyes Remember that it's easy to add but not so easy to remove small amounts! Also, blend like yo life depends on it! Blend!! Set aside a lot of time to complete it, never rush. :) Apply a highlight at the inner corner of your eye to brighten and contrast :) Wet the brush or pencil for smoother, more intense smoky black! Don't go straight to black!  Build up the colour slowly until you get the wanted effect and colour :) also make sure everything is blended out and no harsh lines :)  Start out soft! You can always add darker colour but hard to take away! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095> Blend to make it look Amazing :) For the perfect Smokey Eye choose colours that match your skin tone and eye colour, so the hard work you put onto you eyelids really pops. Start with really light colours and use small brushes for the darker colours- nothing worse then smudging! Blend, blend and blend. Then blend some more (; go from outside in!! slowly build up the colors and don't be afraid to go bold and sparkle as long as you feel gorgeous!! and tape along outer edge of eye is great for making the outer eye shape c: Blend and put tape across the corner of your eye so you get a really noce crisp smokey look go from outside in and blend :D Blend blend and more blend!

Song is catchy though not a taylor fan but she is so cute She is nasty Alana Crook Looks like she had a lot of fun making the video and letting some personality out I dont even care for her to look................ Ashlee Cilia was never a fan of her but i like love story Lol watch this - Lauren Walker thought u might want some of the bum moves Sarah Krstitovic Tessa Fraumano new song ! Not really a ""fan"" of hers but the song is rather catchy and the clip is amusing and light hearted

I have to admit I only watched cause the article to begin with makes it out to be a wannabe with the whole ""trying to rap""  and the still shot was of her with the all the girls twerking  in that outfit but it's was really good haha hey look.....Miley Cyrus number 2 haha everyone judging by the photo:') LOVE IT Absolutely horrible!

However yeah on its own without the video it's not that great. Terrible Jess Yuk Jessie I love the song coz she is telling haters to get stuffed"

It's GYM, no glamour needed. <U+270C><U+FE0F><U+270C><U+FE0F><U+270C><U+FE0F> Yes, I have a birth mark I like to conceal.=] Hell yes lol Yes! Hell no! Yep gotta look good working out ;) I don't go to the gym :) I solve myself the problem of having to decide by simply not entering a gym . :p got my own gym @ home, its black flat & sitting infront of it now lol 
Oh lip gloss natural makeup yes! Same as Lisa x lord no :P Umm no. How ridiculous haha God yes doesn't it depend on who else is at the gym ? ;) Mascara, lipgloss and mineral powder or SPF tinted moisturiser <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> Hell no, But I have a boyfriend and go to a ladies gym so no need to impress anyone ;-) No way Definitely not! If I already had it on for work or something then yes! Otherwise no. Why bother Yes lol... but i hardly go to the gym Yes! I do my brows, conceal dark circles and mascara! Only if I already have it on (from after work or whatever).. If I get up in the morning I don't bother.. Just moisturise :) If you wear makeup to the gym, you ain't working hard enough! A good, sweaty workout means makeup that feels and looks filthy, so it's much better to go without! Plus the feeling of the fan/breeze on your bare face is amazing!
I'd only ever have it on if I went after work, and even then, it's not much :) Just a light coat of mascara on my top lashes because my eyelashes are light and I need to prove I actually have them! Nothing else, I don't like the idea of my pores opening from getting hot and makeup and sweat mixing in my face! Yuck! No. Your pores? ! Haha hell no! If you look good during and after your workout you definitely haven't gone hard enough l only go for me not to impress anyone Small amount of mascara,  like Chantelle I have very fair eyelashes (and all body hair). No Nup, sweat opens pores and having make up on could easily clog the pores. Absolutely!  I don't care what anyone says, if I want to look fabulous at the gym, I damn well will!  I'm not trying to impress anyone, I'm just being me. Yeeeeeeesssss if Im wearing it during the days and I go to the gym at night, I'm not going to bother taking my makeup of Don't go to gym No! It's so bad for your skin! Yep :p too many hot guys ;) Mascara yes Only if i am already wearing it. Wont apply it just to gym. All the boys are too busy looking at themselves to worry what us girls look like! Haha If it's already on for the day! Sometimes if its straight after school and work Yes I do . Only if I go straight after work Nope! Not worth the horrible skin! Just about the only place I go makeup free, just cos it's bad for ur skin while ur sweating it all out. But I do wear lippy so I don't look totally washed out, I'm a makeup junkie so I allow myself that at least lol.<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> No Odd occasions i wear mineral foundation when I'm having one of those insecure ""ugly"" days, but 99% the time - no. Well if I'm working out and i haven't taken my mascara off but I don't even bother with foundation or anything like that so! Haha Leah Waddington fake lashes smokey eye red lip xx Can't be lookin fugs Leah Waddington Kayla Brooke Too lazy and too sweaty for makeup NO Only if i go straight from work.. No.. why would u? Unless I've had it on all day then thats the only time I would. If I already had it on No way what's the point? only if im wearing it before! no point i'll end up sweating it off! I do my workouts at home and run at the parks.

so i dont really need the makeup on.

the gym is a public area and you sorta need to smell nice and look decent because there is so many people using the gyms. Dont want to make a fool out of yourselves No way! I used to, but I've become more confident now and even take it off if I've been wearing it during the day Heck no! If you feel the need to wear make up to gym you may as well wear it to bed.. Love letting my skin breath and sweat out all the other gunk! waterproof makeup is a must if i do!! dont want mascara running down my cheeks on the treadmill Not unless I want to look like I'm slowly melting ;)"

Clock strikes upon the hour,
And the sun begins to fade (while TEEN POP stands out),
Still enough time to figure out (so many shades to choose),
How to chase my indecisiveness away,
I've done alright till now,
TEEN POP shows me how,
And when the night falls,
TEEN POP COLOUR INJECT calls!
[Chorus 2x:]
Oh! My lips just wanna dance with somebody (Australis Lippy)
Wanna feel ï¿½Kakadu plumï¿½ with somebody
Yeah! She wanna dance with somebody
With AUSTRALIS who loves me and my lips!
I've been in LIPPY LOVE and lost my CENTS,
Spinning through the town,
Sooner or later the SEARCH ends,
And I wind up feeling down,
I need a LIPPY who'll take a chance,
On a COLOUR that feels HOT enough to last,
So when the night falls,
My favourite AUSTRALIS LIPPY calls,
Ooh yeah, uh HUN, ooh yeah! Can can is heaven! Samba, makes me feel like dancing because it looks great on me! Mambo, because you can wear it with everything!! Hula because Spring is just around the corner and nothing screams Spring as much as peaches and corals ;) Can can for those winter mornings where you want a pop of colour without the need for effort! Hannah McDonald Lick the icing, because its a pretty colour and looks really nice on :) Ballet. The go with everything colour which is perfect for my skin tone. CAN CAN!

Ballet, makes me want to point my toes and leap for joy. Ballet gives me the gracefulness I need not just for a glittery stage, but for everyday life aswell. :) <3
 I can't possibly choose one favourite, it's like naming your favourite child. One fun summer morning I'll put on 'lick the icing' to get that gorgeous glow, then when I go out with the girls it's time for 'Cha Cha', and when I feel a bit like Beyoncï¿½ 'Gangsta Rap' comes out to play! x :I'd love to Inject some purple Colour into my life so the Can can is the favourite luscious lippy for me - Purple certainly  Rains in my house!"

I love the feel and coverage of the fresh and flawless powder I can definitely see how that made the list but you guys should make a lighter shade that isn't pink toned! The lightest shade you currently have, in not just the powder but in all your foundations and powders it's just too dark for fair skin and slightly too orange toned but every make up brand that has a pale enough shade it always oxidises to pink :( Damnit pale people problems!

To win all you have to do is tell us, what do you do to keep your brow game on point every day?",photo,,248,430,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Line, fill, set and highlight the brow bone <3 Brush them everyday as they curly and unruly!! Chuck a spoolie through it and some brow gel and out the door! Nothing. Oh wait I use an eyebrow brush or comb. Other than that not much.. I use a clear mascara to keep them in place Eyeshadow with an angled brush :) Get them tinted! I use tinted brow gel and conceal underneath. Then a little brush through. ^-^ i use australis tint my brow to tame my unruly hairs i use a gel and mascara wand through it ... and eyeshadow . mascara :) and eyelinerrrrrrrrr Fill and brush. Mine have zero colour Draw them on <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00B9> Pluck them! Treat, fill and set <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0081> Clear mascara! You don't need fancy pants eyebrow gel but this pack will be perfect to fill in any spots that have been over-tweezed and make my eyebrows look perfect. Define eyebrows by filling them in a bit then highlight brow bone :) Firstly use a brow pencil, make sure to comb it through so they're well shaped, and then set them with a slightly darker powder so no hairs pop out of place during the day, and my colour is more perfectly matched! xx Brow brush and a perfectly matched eyeshadow :) I use eyebrow cake powder. Very natural Brow gel to stop those strays from ruining my form! Fill them in!  can hardly see my natural ones so it makes a big difference haha! <3 My $2 shop pencil works wonders!! I use two mirrors to make sure no strays have popped up!, a bit of brown shadow - brown pencil and Im good to go! Unfortunately it involves colouring them in & trying to make them appear fuller. Too much over plucking has lead to them to stop growing. This pack would be amazing! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D> Eyelids droop and brows creep towards the lids as we age, so keeping brows natural with a slight arch will open up the eyes. Brow hairs also become finer and sparser, its recommended  filling them in with a brow powder. I have almost invisible eyebrows ...joys of blonde hair... so i lightly shade them in...im also lucky in that i dont have to pluck them but occasionally i might find a stray one. This pack would be perfect for my morning routine :) I get mine threaded once a month for the perfect shape and fill them in with brow powder everyday. I have no eyebrow game <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00AD> Keep them tamed fill dem in Brush line fill using eyebrow angle brush concealer in the arch and above brow Rebecca Ludlow Savannah Tane Pluck away stray hairs every night, comb my brows into place and set with a good brow tint! Brow tint and a blonde pencil! 
If my brows don't need any doing I just use a spoolie brush just to fix the strays if i don't wanna remove the hairs myself! Tweeze then fill in with Benefit eye shadow! Fortnightly, I place my trust in a fantastic Brow Artist, and all I need to do is brush them! Get that angled brush, get that powder, fill them in sleek, eyebrows on fleek. Fill them in . pluck and thread nothing else so this would be amazing Brow tint and brow pencil <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> I need to! I let mine grow naturally and they are a bit wild so this pack will definitely help!! Just a quick brush and some clear mascara! Would love to have a proper brow set though! Demonic sacrifice usually works for me. Brow pencil lightly, and mascara Fill them in! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> Brow pencil.. I dont do my brows thats why i need yo start x Brow gel and powder Eyebrow pencil&powder,then Eyebrow gel to secure them in place. Brows frame your eyes so they can't be forgotten! :) Pluck, shape, shade, draw and comb keeps them neat n tidy Shape and fill them in <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> Pluck the greys!!! Luckily, I have my trusty Australis clear Eyebrow and Lash Mascara to keep my brows perfectly manicured and in place all day long!

Using a wax product to hold them in place I brush my eyebrows using a toothbrush that I have jus for my brows. and I use eyebrow liner and afterwards apply eyebrow tamer to get those hairs sticking up flat :D I speak sternly to them to keep them in line! :) I actually can't leave the house without filling in my brows. Otherwise you just can't see them. They don't exist. I spooly comb, fill in with powder. And in days where I mean buisness, set them by spraying hairspray on my spooly and then combing again :) This looks incredible. I so need it. I've run out of my brow stuff so have just been using a eye shadow for now! X Fill. Fill. Set with powder. All day every day! I outline with a pencil with a very light hand ,and use an eyebrow tint from Australis to achieve abit of depth while still maintaining a natural look, then abit of concealer around the edges to sharpen the line, and a spoolie to evenly disperse the product and all done! :-) I wish I could have a good brow day :( but in general just fill them in with powder and set with a clear brow gel Aargh mine are going really light at the ends, it looks hideous to say the least!!! Thank goodness for make up and the magic of brow pencils. I fill mine in with brow gel and powder. My eyebrows are shockingly sparse need all the help I can get! :P Everything I can. Fill them in then set with a gel. And hope every day is a good brow day! Lock myself in my room to keep my little one at bay while I pluck and fill in as much as possible until i hear silence. Silent toddler means destruction Pencil and gel every day! Comb, run wax through to tame and then fill in for shape ;) I use a brow kit to shape & fill in
Works a treat <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0080> constant battle to keep them coloured and even, and try to resist too much plucking Comb, gel, fill. Everyday after plucking n shaping I use the MUA power brow and highlight underneath the brow bone Fill them in and attempt to shape them (: 
I keep telling myself "" eyebrows are sisters not twins"" sigh... I have no brow game! I pluck my eyebrows for shape but sadly that's it <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+009E> I hope for the best Primer, concealer, eyebrow gel and then setting spray. Those babies don't move until I scrub them off :) Pluck, fill, gel, fixing spray :) I try to make them at angles with well presentable with brow gel this pack will definitely add life to them!! I brush them through. This is the most essential step for me before I use powder and after I've applied it. I recommend a soft square tipped brush for well defined brows :) x I pluck to make them even altho not always Brows frame the face. I have to fill them in to get the perfect brow. Pluck, fill with pencil and brush I use a light ash brow powder and then comb them into place. I also highlight under the brow to give more definition <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0084> Make sure they are perfectly pucked, then use my brow comb to make them stay in place, use my brow pencil to define my eyebrows then da da! All perfect :D I pluck just a tad as my brows are already pretty fab, just saying ;) Although, I could do with this ultimate eyes pack in my life right now :) <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+0080> Try and shape them, usually over do it then have to fill them in till they grow back!  Then the process is releated ! The struggle is real! Lol :) I do what I can with what I have left! So need this kit! Comb them, pluck them, then pencil to fill them in! Mine are so gappy otherwise hahaha. I dont! I need help :( Plunk them and some times wax then I comb them down amd wet them with water. It takes forever to get them looking half decent.  :( I do them in the car on the way to work...it's risky but I like to live dangerously I fill them in I don't have one, wax maybe once a year.  I need a brow game helppp! Shape & fill Plucked my brows too much when young but now dont have any so brow pencil ,need help! I shape them but that's all I do. I need this to help me get started Fill them in with eye shadow haha I dnt hva clue!!!! I brush my brows every day, pluck and astray hairs and then apply brow product if I'm wearing makeup, if not I set with a brow wax or gel and I'm done. I trim them according to growth. Cry, as my brows as so uneven and attempt to fill them with a pencil. I use a brow pencil. That's all I have. It does the job I suppose <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008F> Pluck any stray hairs. Ive been looking for a decent brow kit to give them a bit of a fix up though as they're naturally very light and fine. I use brow powder but would love to try your wax Use a brow kit to keep them put and in order elf brow kit and set them with a clear mascara to keep them in place all day Quick check and pencil in any gaps and away I go :) scissors cut the stray spikie ones got a mind of there own shape, fill and eyebrow gel is a must have <U+2665>_<U+2665> Pray to the gods while crying that my eyebrows will be perfect #firstworldproblems A strong team talk and a quick lifting session  i always wake up every morning and i clean my brows, then i put my makeup on and then i tint them. eyebrow kit would be so handy ! Brush them everyday and make sure there isn't a hair out of place x Keep them trimmed!! Easiest way to keep them managable :) Fill em in! Brown eyeliner and setting gel <U+2764><U+FE0F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> I lovelovelove the Australis ""tint my brows"" and I tell everyone about it!
 But I think it's time to take my brow game to the next level ;) I kept a baby toothbrush from my boys and spray with a little lacquer each morning - perfectly brushed and they stay put! Also very easy to clean the brush each week <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0084> I use vaseline! But thats only because I don't have anything proper to set them with haha would love to try this set! I show them my cactus every morning.... keeps 'em on point for sure I spend most of my time doing my eyebrows when it comes to putting on makeup. It takes me about 25mins. I wash my face including the brows. Then I brush them to the shape I want. If necessary pluck/wax them. I use brow pencil to darken and shapen thy eyebrows but not pack it on like most girls these days. Then I would use my brow gel to set it. Tbh I wouldn't be using a brow pencil if I had quite a lot of eyebrow hair but my eyebrow hair are always falling and thinning :'( I make sure I keep up with maintenance :) fill then in set them with powder and off I go x Plucking and brow powder with angled brush ended with clear brow mascara Smooth them to shape, fill them in and plucking them <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+009E> still don't look great <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008E> Shave them off! A dash of hairspray on a toothbrush and a once over brush keeps them going all day! Pluck the stray hairs and fill them in with a brow powder because they are really light Monthly visits to the beauty salon, wax + tint Brush up, fill with powder and set with a gel <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008C> To keep my brow game on point? Shape refine and blend <U+2661> Brush them and plucl them I did my 3D tattoo eye brows to have a good curve and i just use brows set to set eyebrow stay strong all day! My partner always teases me about my eyebrows as they are so thin but that's me and then I heard it ages you, 'having thin eyebrows' aaarrghhh HELP ME PLEASE I CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS!   I need to win to have some idea of what to do??                                                    Desperate and Eyebrowless!  :-(   (:-) Brush! I don't know how. It's why the kit would help so much. If be able to give it a go. I had a tattoo and now I pluck away the untame ones and colour in perfect every time Brush, pencil and pluck. It is a joke among many how much time is put into my eyebrows, one a fortnight there is the tedious sit down with a mirror, tweezers and a big blinding light pointed at my eyes for an hour as i sit and pluck every tiny tiny stray hair. Then every day its my trusty medium angled eyeliner brush and a golden brown with a dash of chocolate brown shadow meticulously filling in the shape, with just an ittybitty dash of shimmer cream liner in a very light white/peach just under the arch and along the top at the front. All this every day to create the perfect eyebrow game! Spray with hairspray to keep them looking on point all day long!! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0081> I use an old mascara to brush, shape and colour in one . I line with a pencil, brush up with a brow brush and seal with a little hairspray :> Twizz the extras untamed ones ,trim with scissors , color powder with an eyebrow brush, highlight the eyebrow arch with highlighter then brush with mascara look wand to even out the look  to tame add gel or wax on them. I get them waxed about every two weeks :O I pluck when there's little strays and fill them in with a pencil, something gel/ wax. :) Who won? Congrats to Aimee :) lucky girl"

You can never go wrong when you stick to the 'basics' or Australis cosmetics for that matter ;) . I will wear it as soon as I can get my hands to one. Doesn't matter what's the next occasion, I feel confident that this dress, neckness and makeup will make me shine even if it is only for a date with my husband at home. I would wear this amazing outfit to the Justin TImberlake concert, if he can bring sexy back so can I. (with a little help from Popbasic and Australis). This LBD and red lippy would look smoking together.

1. Apply a base coat of your favourite spring pastel. Weï¿½ve gone for the dreamy Friend Like Me.
2. Once completely dry, cover half of each nail by placing a small piece of tape across diagonally. We find Scotch tape works best, as the others can leave sticky residue.
3. Apply a complementary spring colour on top. Weï¿½ve chosen Citrus.
4. Only when itï¿½s completely dry should you remove the tape. Voila! Donï¿½t forget your top coat!",photo,,117,6,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Pretty ! Love nice hints :D Kristie Habersatt Nice colours Kendall White

Phoebe Joy Morgan deserves it because she has put up with me for 12 years and she is poor and is running out of make up. After working hard all year and doing all the household chores, to win an Australis Essentials Pack would be like a surprise from Santaclaus Dianne Childs deserves this as she always raves about how great Australis Cosmetics is. Kerry Lee Hooper is an awesome best friend because we both laugh from the bottom of our bellies when we are around each other.

Zac Hall Tegan KLohan Briggs Hi Australis just a quick note - Charlestown Square NSW Priceline is consistently out of stock of most of your products. I work in the centre and for months on end nearly half the Australis display has been missing. They have little paper signs stuck up saying ""Supplier is out of stock"". I brought this up to the manager of the store however it might be worth a rep of yours chasing it up - other places that stock Australis seem to have no issues and the products they say are ""out of stock"" (most of them...!) are certainly available at other stores within the same shopping centre. 
Very annoying when sales like this one start, it's virtually pointless going there as I know they have very little of your products! OHHH when are the new velourlips colours out!!? i hope while this sale is on, so then i can get all of them :) Jennifer Trang Still wish you sent to nz :( finally was able to get the contour palette online .. it wasnt in priceline but its back up online with australis..

- the moment I step out the door (because bold lips make me feel like I can take on the world!)

- at concerts (forever the rock chick at heart, and a crucial part of a rock chick's ensemble is sexy lips)

- in my YouTube vids (I love reviewing and supporting Australian companies, and this line of  lippies always make a cameo!)

- on date night with my boyfriend. Because let's face it, it's sexy seeing lipstick marks on his cheek ;-)

I can't stabd liquid lipsticks that you need to apply 2649288 coats for. The smell omg -the smell is what originally drew me to velourlips. I don't know what it is but holy hell I love it. Literally every time I'm in a store where I can smell smell, I do! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> and not to mention they're cruelty free which is a massive plus.

I've used so many liquid to matte lipsticks some costing over $25.00 less than half the price for a far superior performance! love them because not only are they top quality, they're beautiful shades as well as cruelty free, created by a trust worthy australian brand, what more could I ask for? Velourlips are my fave because the colours are so intense and they last forever! I don't have to reapply over and over again to keep the shade and they make me feel as close to a makeup artist as possible because someone who struggles at makeup like me can pull these off easy! :) I love velourlips because
1  very pigmented when you apply to your lips 
2 it really gives you the matte finish like they promise.
{ i try the expensive one but they dont do what they promise also its so expensive.}
3 it doesn't smell like plastic or even taste like one.
{ some expensive one got the same problem they smell and so stickz }
4 they stay long as in long to your lips without thinking it might come off when you eat or drink
5 they're really friendly on your pocket
6 the color is so bright and doesnt fade or smudge
7 its product of our very own australia
8 the case or bottle of velour lips is air tight. If you notice some lip gloss or lipstick in a tube when you put them back inside the white protector on the inside always pup out because of the air inside. Velour lips tube dont do it.
9 its not messy and easy to store in your bag
10 if theres a chance you left velour tube at home you have confidence thats the one your lips will last longer
11 theres no harsh chemical that you need to worry about. 
12 all in all i love It and i bought 6 of them. Cant wait to throw away all my old lipstick. The colour range and staying power is amazing.

I recommend Velourlips to everybody who asks, ""what lippy is that you're wearing?""
The colours are one of a kind and being budge proof all day - what more can a girl ask from her lip colour? <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C> When is this drawn? I can't stand the suspense!

My signiture eye look consists of earthy brown tones and oranges. I like doing a smokey eye and using a black eyeliner to emphasize my inner corner. Orange and brown tones make my blue eyes pop and the black eyeliner makes the look so much better. I'm pretty boring with brown tones usually, and every so often add a really bright pop of colour into the inner corner! I love using the screw up coloured Australis eyeliner! My signature eye look begins with a primer over my lids. After that, I apply a shade that is slightly lighter than my skin tone under the eyebrow on the brow bone and blend that down, adding a slightly darker shade over my entire lid. Then I apply a light gold shimmery shadow below the crease, and then use a medium brown in the crease and blend that in. If I'm going for something a little bit flashier, I'll sometimes apply a pink shimmer toward the inner corner of the eye, and the same brown used in the crease in the outer corner. Occasionally I'll run a little bit of the gold shadow under my waterline on the lower of my eye. Follow that up with a subtle brown eyeliner, and then finish off with a dark brown mascara. For my brows I usually just use an angled brush to apply some brown eyeshadow, and set it with a brow setting gel. I'm trying to go out of my comfort zone and get into some stronger and more interesting colours, as this look is usually fairly subtle. Cheers for the opportunity to participate in the competition :) I don't wear eye make up currently but would start with this great set, will read the comments for great tips.

Black and smokey 
all the way,
I get my fierce on 
every day!! I love smokey eyes and a touch of shimmer. Liquid eyeliner if I really wanna stand out! Comp ends in March? I love to K.I.S.S my eye make up- Keep It Simple Silly with smoky brown  highlights to bring out my blue eyes. It's a simple look but it's beautiful especially when matches with effortlessly toussled hair! I follow my 3 E's.

Step one: Enhance. I have brown eyes so I like to enhance them with purple mascara and a smudge of purple eye shadow along the top and bottom lash line to bring out the brown. 

Step two: Elevate. Two wings - one so sharp and fierce it could kill a man and the other so wobbly you'd think a child with a crayon did it in comparison to Van Gogh's art on the left eye. But in the end, they're wings and they help me soar through my day :)  

Step three: Errrhm eyebrows. I'll fill 'em in based on my mood and what I want the world to see me as that day.

And I'm set! I like a simple, classic look so just some liquid black eyeliner along my upper and lower lash line, with a gentle upward sweep at the corner, and some quality volumizing and lengthening black mascara to finish it off. I start off with my eyeliner, wing it and then go on to the mascara to achieve nice and long eyelashes, and if I am bothered, I would also fill in my brows Love wearing my false lashes, and enhancing them with only the most FIERCE mascara! Taupes and golds are my go-to shades, as they brighten my eyes and make them look larger! Paired with inky winged black liquid liner, voluminous mascara coated lashes(..maybe even falsies ;)) and perfectly on point brows, this look can take me from day to night in a flash! I like to do a smokey eye using metallic kinda colours and i finish the look with a simple winged liner and do half of my bottom lid with black or white eyeliner depending on my mood A Shimmer of shadow.. A lick of Mascara and a winged eye, which takes precision but then makes my eyes POP! :) Just a question Australis Cosmetics the end dates says 29/03/2015? I presume this isnt correct. When is the end date? Thanks <U+2661> The Smokey Eye

Tell us your tips and tricks when applying eyeliner youï¿½ll be in with a chance! T&Cï¿½s apply.,photo,,70,51,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Using a long lasting  pencil along my upper eye lid I apply a tiny bit of eye cream to help it glide not pull. use with a white eyeliner under your to eyeshadow to make it really stand out Don't be afraid to Change the colour occasionally for a totally different look ..blues greens & teals can look amazing enhancing  your natural eye colour If you're finding it hard to apply your eyeline in this colder weather because it's dragging, warm it up by rolling it in your hands briefly to warm up the oils. Skip free lining! I use tape to do my wings .. helps me get an even application on. The best Idea I have found to apply! Always use colours that match your eyes .. Experiment with colours too I use two different eyeliners to make my eyes pop . One light and one dark! Tape, my god tape works wonders. There's always a roll ready to use stashed in my makeup kit. It helps to Crete any design with a sleek, mess free finish. My winged eyeliner method: hold your breath, dont rush and have cotton tips at the ready for mistakes!  :P Fast and the furious is our house hold tip for who can get to the bathroom and mirror first. ..I try to apply appropriately. Use gel eyeliner, its much easier to apply and rest elbow on a bench when applying for support-no poking yourself in the eye!  :) Dont drink before applying lol as you need a steady hand. Either have a steady hand or i get my daughter to do it as she can see what she is doing Make sure you can see clearly :) Always have a steady arm and practice makes perfect! Cotton buds are my best friend take a deep breath before applying it helps me to relax and never be afraid of experimenting A magnifying mirror makes it a hell of a lot easier Make your eye makeup last longer by setting your eyeliner with a matching eye shadow :) My magnifying light mirror, pull the skin tight when drawing on my eye lid, taking my time & cotton tips to fix any mistakes. Also I put white liner on the inside, help makes my eyes pop & look bigger:) A light brush of Australis Cosmetics Bronzing Powder, a smidge of Australis Cosmetics Gold Gaga Metallix Eyeshadow, a fine smudged line of Australis Cosmetics Cray for Colour 'Drawn to Diamonds' Eye Pencil & finish it all off with a coat of Australis Cosmetics Fierce Eyes Mascara ;) Do the eyeliner so your eyes stand out not the other way around were the first thing you notice is the eyeliner... Trying to have a steady hand, and using Australis ready SET go translucent powder to set my liquid liner so it doesn't transfer to my lid You have to be cool calm and collected to be sure you don't have a shaky hand! Always draw with the pencil/liner on a very close angle to your face - not pointing at your eye! Gently sweep from the outer eyelid towards the lash line,  this also reduces pull on the eyelids and makes for a smooth line :) I only use eyeliner on my top water line and then false lashes, I don't do the whole eyeliner on my eyelids haha xD Practice makes perfect and I have been practicing the winged liner since the 80s before it was so cool and now im a master :) 
Check me out with my winged liner and le tan bikini from the 80s :) To stop your eyeliner from smudging, use black eyeshadow to set it. Take time, small little strokes is best and then join together, make a mess if needed, and tidy up with cotton tips! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> To stop eyeliner smudging. The best fix is to pat a little translucent powder or concealer on top of your liner. It'll help dry things up right away, keep liner from sliding off oily skin, and help prevent it from shifting when you blink. To get the perfect cat eye . Use two pieces of Scotch tape to create a triangle at the outer corner of your eye, then fill in with liner, remove the tape, and you get a perfect flick. Curl your lashes and apply eyeliner all in one by drawing the pencil on the curler. Pencil on bottom, liquid on top. Try to make the top line as thin as possible so if you make a mistake you have room to fix it. Pull the skin tight at the outside corner of your eye so then skin on your eyelid is tight and you can get a nice straight line. Don't blink until it's dry. Fix up any little mistakes with a damp cotton tip! White eyeliner on lower rim, and along eyelash line , eyelash Curler. Sprayed with hairdpray all while holding mouth in a O expression Apply a lighter shadow in the corners of your eyes and only line the outer part of your eyes to open them up and make them brighter start from the wing tip then draw the liner towards your inner eye. always gives me a clean line and even wing :) I use tape to make a perfect straight winged eye liner and it works every time. I also keep it steady and work on it slowly instead of drawing the whole line and then making mistakes. :)) I don't know anybody else but I always have trouble putting on eyeliner. Use dots or dashes if you're still not confident of applying a straight line in one go. Apply small dots or dashes along the line you want and then join them with a larger line. Practice, practice and more practice helps too! Lovely eyes Lineweight is so important I start from the inner end of my lash line very thin then trace to the center of the lid from there i draw almost a straight line out to the outer counter then joint the end of the line and the outer section of my lash line, fill in the gap and finally apply a little of the outer third of the bottom lash line and smudge it along the rest Using tape from the lower lash line to the end of the brow for the perfect application every time I wear eyeliner every day.. The tip is practice makes perfect.. Each day looks that bit better!!  :) definitely practicing regularly and looking through different youtube tutorials to see other people's technique. my favourite one is using a pencil liner to draw a basic shape first, so mistakes can be corrected and so that there is a basic outline of the line, so much easier for beginners! I just fluke it! Small little lines joined up,  usually ends up well ;) Remove your bra and put on trackie daks. Trick that eyeliner into thinking you are just playing around with makeup, because the moment you mention plans 'mistakes' are gonna happen! Lots of practice - and cotton tips to clean up mistakes! I start with the flick to point to the end eyebrows so if they are uneven and you need  to re do its not messing up the whole eye. Then draw a line towards inner eye and thicken to what ever mood I'm in on that day. 
If i wanna bring my eyes out more id use a white  shadow on the bottom  line from the inner to middle  out and use a gold on the outer side. Black liner half way along ur eyes (top eyelid) white eyeliner makes eyes look younger / fresher... Use white on inside of bottom eyelids, black on the outside - accent wirh a small flick for extra drama- top with plenty of mascara!!! When applying liner, try not to pull the skin on the side of your face and if things get a little messy, clean up your line with a makeup remover-soaked cotton swab. Use a felt tip eyeliner for the winged look, it doesn't smudge as easily and will last longer. Use tape to get a perfect even wing :) Buy every single type of eyeliner so you are set for every occasion - love a purple wing every now and again! To get the perfect wing cut a triangle into an old bank card etc... and then place it in the position your want you wing and then just fill it in! Perfect every time <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D>"

Dear Australis, would you consider helping our campaign?                  Many thousands are speaking up for the captive performing dolphins at Sea World Gold Coast Australia with the help of international and local celebrities but we also need your help, and voice.

Jane Goodall says ""SeaWorld Needs To Be Immediately Shut Down"" as does Harry Styles, Bianca Jagger, Martina Navratilova, Anthony La Paglia, Simon Cowell, Shailene Woodley, Pamela Anderson, Olivia Newton John, Ricky Gervais, Edie Falco, Steve Backshall, Bryan Adams, Matt Damon, Matthew Modine, Susan Sarandon, Kelly Slater, Willy Nelson, Cher,Rachel Hunter, Tommy Lee, Jennifer Aniston, Maggie Q, Nicholas Hoult, Kim Basinger, Rob Zombie, Sir Brian May, Stephen Fry, Jessica Chastain, Paul Rudd, Woody Harrelson, Rita Wilson, Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Lea Michele, David Crosby, Courtney Cox, Dave Navarro, Zach Braff, Wynonna Judd, Kathy Griffin, Jessica Biel, Mariska Hargitay, James Gandolfini, John Leguizamo, Russell Simmons, Olivia Wilde, Scout LaRue Willis, Kelly Le Brock, Russell Brand, Joan Jett, Howard Stern, Aaron Paul (from 'Breaking Bad'), Kathy Najimy, Niki Taylor, Hayden Panettiere, Mayim Bialik, Meg Matthews, Chet Faker, Wil Anderson, Todd McKenny, Christine Anu, Steve Kilbey, Marcia Hines, Sia, Tyson Beckford, Sinnitta, Ewan McGregor, Matt Goss, Leona Lewis, Angie Bowie, Steve-O, Conan O'Brien, Elvira, Josh Groban, Jason Biggs, Motley Crue, Arianna Grande, Krysten Ritter, Chloe Lattanzi, Sharni Vinson, Samantha Fox, Alexandra Paul, Gina Liano, Jonathan Coleman, Alyce Platt, The Veronicas, Tracey Spicer, Adam Zwar, Lincoln Lewis, Phil Jamieson (Grinspoon), Anthony Ackroyd, Livinia Nixon, Jane Barnes, Former Miss Universe Australia Laura Dundovic, Havana Brown, Simone Buchanan, Cheyenne Tozzi, Caitlin Stasey, Silvana Philippoussis, Ella Hooper, Bianca Dye, Arj Barker, Jamie Reyne, Annalise Braakensiek all say:

AUSSIE DOLPHINS HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM THE OCEAN AND SOME BRED IN CAPTIVITY BUT ALL ARE FORCED TO PERFORM DAILY AT SEA WORLD ON THE GOLD COAST, QUEENSLAND.

""The whole world is up in arms about Sea World and other aquaprisons. It's time that Australians opened their eyes and became educated to the cruelty of trapping and breeding dolphins as money-making slaves for greedybusinesspeople"".

'SEAWORLD SHUT DOWN on Facebook. The First & Only Campaign Against Sea World in Australia' .

Trevor Long, Marine Science Director at Sea World Gold Coast says: ""Dolphins aren't some amazing creature, in the wild they just rape and rape and rape"". (Quoted from Gold Coast Bulletin interview January 2015).

Please help us to speak up for the captive performing dolphins at Sea World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.

We love them rescuing cetaceans but we loathe them keeping dolphins as captives in their aquaprison.

The dolphins need to be rehabilitated and freed or taken to a safe sanctuary/bay/cove paid for by Sea World to live out their lives without human interference.

India, Croatia, Hungary New York, South Carolina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Nicaragua, Slovenia, Switzerland, Brazil, Poland, Luxembourg, Norway and the U.K have already banned cetaceans in captivity and so far there are over 18,000 signatures on the petition and a Facebook page with over 10,820 followers. Also on Twitter @seaworldisevil with over 6,990 followers

The dolphins are caught from the ocean and brought to tanks/lagoons and are also bred in captivity where they are forced to perform for paying customers and given dead fish but only if they do tricks. All to make money for greedy Sea World business people.

Reloaded Aroshi Pandu Holly Carran such a good idea!! Alex O'Toole Isabella Louise Mauzzachelli-Thompson Katie Gorman Attaching a short eye liner pencil (that's too small to hold) to the end of a new pencil with a rubber band. Now it has a long 'handle' and you can keep using it Victoria Adeline Lori Jane Melville Pop two drops of Saline solution (contact solution) in the mascara bottle. Shake really well. Be careful not to put too much in because then it gets messy and extremely wet. 
Just like a brand new bottle (almost)! Cream Pot Eye Liner  -  Apply a drop of oil free moisturiser to the pot with a Q-tip or toothpick. Allow it to sit for a few minutes and then gently stir. This moistens the creaminess back to normal and it is then ready for use, Caro Jenkins If  sharpening doesnï¿½t work on your good pencil eye liner,  itï¿½s usually because the product has dried out inside the stick. The best way to fix this is to use a hairdryer. Hold the pencil a few centimetres away from the blowdryerï¿½s nozzle, and move the dryer back and forth along the length of the pencil. This will consistently warm the product and melt it just a little; in about thirty seconds, your pencil liner will be as good as new.

Hi Australis I love your cosmetic range and since going cruelty free, then you guys are the best. However I have recently purchased this new foundation and do not like it compared to your old one. I find it really flaky and makes my skin look really old not vibrant and glowing like the way you advertise it. Please re stock you old foundation as well as I prefer this much better.

Great colour and amazing pigmentation and softness I love my Australis products, i can't pick a fave! I am currently using the 'Lick the Icing' lipstick which is fab, i get compliments about it all the time.  The 'Mix it' foundation which provides perfect coverage for me & I've got almost every single Australis nail colour, i love them because they are so easy to apply & they look lovely.

(Not to mention it smells AMAZING- and is cruelty free! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095>) The banana powder. It is exactly what I need to brighten my dark circles.

I also love the eyebrow pencils and pressed powder foundation. I just love everything australis The Australis fresh and flawless powder! It is my holy grail of all makeup items! Lasts all day and my makeup doesn't budge. The best thing ever <U+2764><U+FE0F> My absolute fave of all time is the pressed powder in deep natural!! I have literally been using it for like 10 years IM NOT KIDDING I still even have a compact from FOR EVER ago :D <3 Metallix eyeshadow in gold gaga, absolutely amazing shade on eyes and I have even been experimenting with it as a glowing highlighter and it's absolutely amazing! Really difficult to choose, particularly as you have high quality, animal-friendly products, which is a HUGE plus!

But I have to stick with the basics and go with the ""Cya Later Pores Primer"". It provides the same texture as other brands that are literally 3x the price, and makes everything sahhhh smooth! Bonus that has worked for me is that even if I don't put tonnes of makeup on top, it evens out my skin tone well enough that I just need a light dusting of powder and I'm good to go.

Even if I don't win this, ladies and gents, you need to get on their primers!!! I love the Australis rapid tan, it's a gift from the gods! It's the only tanning product I use and it makes my skin so radiant! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><U+263A><U+FE0F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BC><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BC> My favourite Australis product is definatly the high life highlighting powder because you can never have too much glow & shimmer on your face in love ! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> Foundation is awesome coverage and long lasting Australis is my fav product: I LOVE the rose water setting spray!

Thanks making a long lasting, matte lipstick that looks ahmazing on the lips and smells. I mix two different colors for a new color or do an ombre lip. Thanks The brow pencils and the creme contour kits are so BLOOMIN AMAZING goddiggitydamn theyre my JAM Sammy Sarah The high life highlighting powder because it gives me face the perfect contour <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0084> I love love love the Australis Metallix eyeshadow in Lana Del Grey  can not beat that colour, perfect on it own but I love using it to make a dark smokey eye pop!! The setting spray!!! I love it!! when I spray it on I feel like I've been frolicking in a field filled with roses eating Turkish delight all day!! It keeps my makeup on all day even during the gym! It's honestly so amazing, and if I'd had a breakout or my skin has reacted to something and it's red and angry I can just spray some on and the rose water helps calm my skin down! 

And then the 4 in 1 concealer, it 100% covers my dark circles or red spots and im super impressed on how well it works for me

And the velvouslips matte lip cream, I love the range of colours they come in and I find that they smell soooo nice!!! And I love how they actually dry matte. There are so many lip creams that claims they dry matte but don't. So I love that these do! Because 1. I love the look of a nice matte lip, and 2. If I'm wearing lipstick my boyfriend won't kiss me unless it's actually 100% matte <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082>

But that one product that i do have is just amazzzzing. Its the ""pressed powder"". 
Keeps my delightfully oily skin on hold for quite some hours.  Its like i said. Amazing!!! I love the Velourlips because they're a great pop of colour during the grey Winter months. And Spring and Summer and Autumn... The 'Oh hai brow!' shaping kit is my life saver. I catch public transport to work and apply my makeup on the train, so I need a product that is: easy to carry, simple to apply but does an amazing job. Not only have I found the product straight forward to use, I can play it up and down depending on the look I go for.

The amount of girls that have complemented my eyebrows is crazy!! Especially while I'm doing them on the train <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A> I wanted to stock up yesterday during the 40% off cosmetics promo at Priceline, but you were completely sold out. That alone just says enough about how popular the products is <U+2764><U+FE0F> The Banana Powder for sure! It's perfect for setting my under-eye concealer and not making me look like a panda (which is something that a lot of other brands have done, so congrats guys!~) The velour lips Bae-Jing. It is with out a doubt the best colour and lipstick I have ever used and I have extremely sensitive lips. Most products irritate but not this. Very awesome product. I recommend it to everyone. When your favorite brand just gets better and better....

Love Australis <3 My first and favourite Australis product is the original contouring kit <U+2665><U+FE0F> when I first started to get interested in makeup I searched high and low for an affordable contour kit and then I found it! Australis you have started a life long makeup addiction within me! AContour and highlighting kit in powder! Omg, it's like picking a favourite child! I'll have to go with the Metallix eye shadows.

It's a product i intend on repurchasing however they are so deep in the pans that they will last me a lifetime! I randomly picked one up on a sale and immediately went back and bought the remaining colours after seeing the quality. So pigmented and they last all day without smudging or rubbing off. I have urban decay eyeshadows that are similar but I prefer these. And they are less than $10. Can't go wrong.

Brow shaping kit! - Nothing looks more finished and polished than totally filled, groomed brows! Brightens up my eyes while giving solid definition to my brows! - Its my - ""I cant live without product!"" I honestly love Australis products because they are cruelty free, most are vegan and are not so expensive! My favourite product would have to be the eyeliner, It's so smooth and stays for so long, and the colour is so intense! I love Ac on tour light contouring and highlighting pallet. It's all in one love the warmer Color, banana and shimmery highlighter especially easier to do  my quick make up in train in mornings. 

Also make up setting spray  it is very refreshing in summers , love the fragrance  of rose water  in it while spraying over my make up. My favourite is my first ever lipstick, a colour inject (I think?) in Mambo. It's my ""old faithful"" and the colour I based my entire look around. I've still got it, there's about 5mm left and the case is cracked, no writing left on it - but it's still sitting proud in my makeup case. A reminder of my style and my love for cruelty free cosmetics. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D> My favourite product is the Australis fresh and flawless pressed powder , it is the best one I have ever used will never use another powder <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C> I only buy australis make up products because they are cruetly free. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+0087>

I'm still no Heidi Klum but I love the finish of it all. Ooh and the nail enamels :) I am obsessed with the metalix eye shadows.

The texture is lovely and mousse like, super pigmented, holds for 14 hours plus without a single crease or crumble. Shades are phenomenally pretty and reflect the light beautifully as well as show deep colour at the same time.  As a major bonus the shades have not caused harm to a single animal.

I love how you challenge the industry with affordable products and innovative new ideas and items that work Kalina Pepper Felicity Bishop My favourite product would have to be the powder contour kit. I have multiple kits but they honestly don't work the same. The Australis contour kit blends nicely and really does work on my pale skin tone. I've recommended it to all my friends My favourite Australis product is the Pressed Powder. I can never fault it. It's light on your skin, doesn't clog your pores and always gives me a fresh and flawless look whether I'm in a hurry or not. I have never turned back to any other pressed compact powders since first using this product. It's definitely a must have beauty product that everyone should have or atleast try! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0096> My fave is the fresh and flawless powders cos they're so full coverage and the price is so.good.

I love the 'Oh Hai Brow Kit' it really makes the  eyebrows look really defined and on camera it enhances your eyebrows and looks astonishing. I would love to win because I would like to buy a lot of Australis products because I love them so much they are my favourite brand of makeup. I've just started my YouTube channel and recently purchased my first Australis product. I absolutely love the High Life Highlighting Powder. It gives a great shimmer and is VEGAN FRIENDLY! That was the main reason I opted for Australis being vegetarian and all. I'm gaining more and more experience but I don't own much makeup. This would give me a great opportunity to do first impressions and get the brand a lot more publicity. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+00B0><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+00B0><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095> The velourlips because there's a colour for every occasion, you only have to any once and it's affordable!

It is the best brow it I have ever tried. Its the only brow kit and brand that gets my eyebrows so defined to perfection. I love how it also comes with tweezers so i can fix stray hairs and a high lighter for under the brows. 
Its easy application and stays on my brows all day. I'm so thankful for your Oh Hai Brow Kit because without good eyebrows its not a good day. I love your contour kit! it's so highly pigmented and there are lovely matte Browns for contouring :) My favourite Australis product would have to be either the 'Matte out mattifying face base' or the colour inject lipsticks because the face base turns all my foundations matte and the lipstick is very moisturising on my lips and aren't harsh like a lot of other ones + you can't beat the low price! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0098><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> The Banana Powder <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BD><U+008C> It's my new favourite powder because it highlights without caking up <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BB> My FAVE Australis Cosmetics product is a new one - I can't pick between those I already own because I couldn't live without any of them. :) My favourite Australis product is the AC Contour and Highlighting Kit in light.

Not only does it go with everything, BUT it's the best lip liner I've ever used. The setting spray!!! I love it!! when I spray it on I feel like I've been frolicking in a field filled with roses eating Turkish delight all day!! It keeps my makeup on all day even during the gym! It's honestly so amazing, and if I'd had a breakout or my skin has reacted to something and it's red and angry I can just spray some on and the rose water helps calm my skin down! 

And then the 4 in 1 concealer, it 100% covers my dark circles or red spots and im super impressed on how well it works for me

And the velvouslips matte lip cream, I love the range of colours they come in and I find that they smell soooo nice!!! And I love how they actually dry matte. There are so many lip creams that claims they dry matte but don't. So I love that these do! Because 1. I love the look of a nice matte lip, and 2. If I'm wearing lipstick my boyfriend won't kiss me unless it's actually 100% matte <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082>

So...for the sake of my entry lol, I'll go choose one and go with my holy grail finishing powder - the Australis Translucent Finishing Powder. 
It doesn't cause break outs, its affordable and it's cruelty free (like all Australis products), and it keeps my makeup looking decently fresh, even after 8 hours with my new bub! 
A definite holy grail product <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008C> 
Thanks Australis! My favourite product is the contour palette, my skin is a brown complexion so I'm finding that the texture of the palette works really well with my foundation and is easy to blend! I've had trouble finding an affordable yet satisfying palette and I found that the Australis contour palette meets my needs.

I also love the banana powder! I bought it today and I'm so totally digging it especially for the colour of my skin. <U+2764><U+FE0F> Velour lipsticks! Love them! They last such a long time, and the colour payoff is amaze!!!!! absolutely love your contour pallet!! the colours are so amazing and so pigmented ! The finishing powder it helps set the makeup and adds that little extra touch. Jasmine Nelson Your primer! Makes foundation stay all day :) My favourite product is you entire line <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>

It is so amazing and the colour stays on for so long I love Australis stayput eyeliner in Bluebird, brings out the blue in my eyes even more!  <3 Oh Hai Brow! Brow shaping kit - I cant believe i have lived so long without it! I feel rought around the edges without it! Its my #1 item I cant live without! It completes my look everytime! Has to be the contour kit! I also use it for my brows it's basically a two in one <U+2764><U+FE0F> My favourite product is the australis pout paste. I have it in every colour! They are vibrant, have amazing staying power, come in a variety of colours. I can't tell u a favourite because I haven't got any Australis products at the moment. I have tried your products in the past like all other brands but I currently only use Nude by Nature & Maybeline I trust these because they work for me but if I had the opportunity to win this I reckon I could then pick something out as my fav is. I'm very interested in trying but unfortunately can't afford to go out & buy all the products to do so. So please pick me I would totally write a good review on Facebook & Instagram about my experiences i absolutely love the Let's Go Steady Tinted Gradual Body Moisturiser! It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, while giving it a healthy glow Loose Translucent powder to top my look with a matte finish :) been wearing it everyday for years without fail <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> I definately  go cray cray for my Maliboo velourlips, its long lasting, smooth, great application, wear time and opacity.

Just love you guys<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009D> The contour kit, the best way to hide a chubby round face to make you feel more confident and beautiful. Amelia Cherie I love the Sunkissed Bronzing Powder because its cruelty free, lasts for hours, can be used to highlight under my brows, and brightens my pale face :) Fresh & flawless powder <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> I really like the metallix eye shadows, they make my eyes look awesome!! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0080> I can't choose they are all amazing!!!! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+008B> Banana powder is multi purpose in that it conceals both my dark under eye circles and patches of redness without caking and drawing attention to the imperfections. It truly is an amazing and extremely affordable product for all ages. You use to have an aqua eyeliner pencil, I used to wear nothing but that particular one! Then one day I couldn't find it anywhere, I used to look in every store that stocked your products just in the off chance it would be there but alas it never was! Every time I wore the eyeliner I was always complimented on how gorgeous it looked & how the colour was amazing. Please, please bring it back!! The contour and highlight kit, so easy to use and i love that its powder with shimmery particles :"") and it looks so good Australis Stay Put Foundation - Nude, does exactly what it says...stays put. Vienna Sirvid The powder contour kit has got to be the best product because out of all the contour kits that exist this is the one that I'll always go to. It's easy to apply, which is useful if you've never contoured before, it's animal cruelty free and it's supporting our economy by buying high quality Australian makeup products that we don't have to spend a fortune on. I use it every day, even when I'm having a lazy day at home. It's by far, the best product. #australisCosmetics  tickled pink lip gloss 
Moisturises , protects  and is the perfect go anywhere subtle colour I love <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095> I'm just tickled pink with it !! There are too many that I love. One is the contour kit, a must for me! The contour kit is the best contour kit I have used and goes on so flawless I study beauty and it's the only contour kit I will use I'm not sure that you make it anymore but the Mineral Purity Powder Foundation changed my life. I stocked up a few years ago and it's my everyday go to foundation. The coverage is perfection. red lipstick that last for so long and has a truly bright color! Dior is resting haha My favourite product is Velourlips Bae-Jing. All of the Veloulips smell amazing, last for ages and come out so pigmented! Bae-Jing is my favourite because its a very wearable pink. didn,t you used to make yummy perfume The salsa lipstick because it's <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+00A3> and it looks amazing plus it's creamy~ Matte out! The best product I've ever seen for creating a shine free look, without having to reapply powder all night! The high life highlighting powder, it's great for contouring the face :) Banana powder, great redness concealer! Velourlips is my favorite. I almost own every shade of it. It is just great and one product for every occasion.. The Ac On Tour Contour Kit , because the highlighters and the yellow powder and the contour shades are just perfect  for when u want a defined , highlighted face when ur in a rush to go out I love their eye shadows. I have been using them since my high school days back in the 90's and still do! My favourite product is velourlips Doo-Bai.
I personally can't stand having anything on my lips but I've found velourlips to be comfortable. Doo Bai velourlips is the only lipstick I've been able to find in my hair colour. I love Australis products and velourlips would have to be my favourite of all! The fresh and flawless powder is the best powder I have ever used by far has the best coverage and studying power. And the velour lips are my favourite liquid lipsticks the colours are insane love love love <U+2661><U+2661> the entire range is brilliant and affordable to anyone Velour Lips for sure! I've tried so many high end products like Kylie Lip Kit, Jeffrey Star & Mac and your Velour Lips is still the best! The biggest range of colours, last all day, a smell to die for and the 5 mini's for $15 kit is a steal! My fav products are Australis pressed powder and the contour kit. They pressed powder is amazing for setting foundation and the contour kits is just amazing it goes on so well and blends really nicely. Velourlips! Every other lipstick / gloss always wears off and leaves my lips dry, but these last forever and have amazing colours and don't dry out my lips <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0084> The stay put foundation!

Mambo is my go to lip colour everyday and I take it everywhere I go and get so many people hooked on it! I love the contour palette it can be used in many different ways. The colours are diverse and suite warm and cool toned skins. The highlighters make the skin look glowing. I also love how light, Medium and dark palettes are available so they can match any skin colour. Every colour is bendable and for $16 I don't know how it is so good. I recommend this product to all my friends and I think it is a must have. Defiantly one of my top beauty products! I LOVE my Bronze Eyed Girl matte eyeshadow palette! All the shades are super usable across the board! I use the lightest shades as blending shades, the yellow one works super well for a setting powder in a pinch! They are so super buttery, little to no fallout, and the colour payoff is amazing!
It's something I'd pay full-price for, and I nearly never buy anything not on sale! I love the Australis Fresh and Flawless powder because no affordable brands make very yellow toned shades and now I'm not going broke trying to set my makeup Lena Lee enter The velour lips is my fav! After discovering them I can finally have a coffee without depositing my lips onto the lid. The longevity of the product is amazing! <3 Ruby Khan Your metallix eye shadows!!

But I have many more products to try, and $200 would certainly help me do that. ^_^ <3
I love your eyeliner,
It makes my eyes pop.
I love Australis,
I like it a lot!! :D My favourite Australis product is there contour palette because it's such a great dupe for the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette. Sarah Jane i love the velourlips range ï¿½ honestly every colour manages to completely reinvent my face or play up different moods or looks! #thanksaustralis #yourock I really like you cream contour kit, affordable, easy to apply with a stippling brush, and the colours are just right. My favourite product with have to be the contour kits both cream and powder
I can finally nicely add shape to my round pumpkin face! Would love to try more products Velour Lip, love them. Love making a custom colour of the day. Sophie Chilcott Metallix eye shadow! It is so creamy and pigmented - it seriously lasts all day! The gold colour is my fave!!!!! I love the banana powder it's an essential in my makeup routine.. Helps cover my bags nicely lol your contour pallet is amazing and so highly pigmented I love the metellix eye shadows!! Can turn even the simplest eye look into something glamorous!!!! Love!!! The powder cream 3 in 1 concealer, foundation and powder would have to be my favourite! It has great coverage, feels nice on the skin and lasts pretty much all day without the need to prime and great on those days you need to leave in a rush :) Rose water setting spray! Keeps my makeup looking gorgeous! Velour lips <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+009A> I have the purple shade, it's dashing <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C> My favourite product is definitely the Velourlips matte lip cream. It is amazing with such vibrant colour and stays for ages. Is great for dancing I can kiss for hours wearing your Velourlips, the staying power is absolutely fantastic! x I love the formula of the clear lip liner- it keeps my lipstick looking fine and now I don't have to buy individual colours. Such a godsend, esp. with those less common lippie colours. I love the velourlips, the colours are beautiful, they last really well without over drying and when I wore Doo-bai to see my favourite drag queen perform she even complimented me on the colour. I love your cream contour kit I have chubby cheeks so yeah lol I love the AC on Tour Contouring Kit Cream  I use it to highlight between my brows to camouflage the frown lines and all the bits of my face that need help it seriously works it is AMAZING  so much so it buys me exra months between botox!! <3 Thanks so much  Australis Cosmetics xx The setting spray!!! I love it!! when I spray it on I feel like I've been frolicking in a field filled with roses eating Turkish delight all day!! It keeps my makeup on all day even during the gym! It's honestly so amazing, and if I'd had a breakout or my skin has reacted to something and it's red and angry I can just spray some on and the rose water helps calm my skin down! 

And then the 4 in 1 concealer, it 100% covers my dark circles or red spots and im super impressed on how well it works for me

And the velvouslips matte lip cream, I love the range of colours they come in and I find that they smell soooo nice!!! And I love how they actually dry matte. There are so many lip creams that claims they dry matte but don't. So I love that these do! Because 1. I love the look of a nice matte lip, and 2. If I'm wearing lipstick my boyfriend won't kiss me unless it's actually 100% matte <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082>

Hon-o-loo-loo is by far my favorite, because with my skintone is so pale lately, the color is bright and inviting to everyone I smile at! I have been complimented many times on this lip color and adore it! I recently wore Doo-bai to the Ipswich Cup Races and it was phenomenal. I wore a bright red dress, with black and cream accessories so Doo-bai was the cherry on top for this outfit! Mixing Lun-dun and Rio-d is the ultimate colour for my pale skin! It was so different but funky in the same way! Compliments all round!

The lightest shade is 2 shades too dark for me. The pasty skin beauties of the world would be ever so grateful for a lighter than light range of oh2glow This foundation is oily, which I assume is the Glow in Oh 2 Glow? It makes it difficult to wear powder, like it WANTS to be the only thing you're wearing. Little coverage, super avoid if you have oily skin. It is a b b cream? I will if a lighter shade is created, as the current lightest is too dark for me. I just bought my second one of this as the first one turned out to be the wrong shade for my skin tone, when I looked at the first bottle I bought to make sure I didn't make the same mistake I realised there is no shade name on the bottle. the only label of the shade was on the outer plastic wrap barcode sticker. Why are the bottles not showing their shade name?"
